Araucaria
Araucarias are the other large 
tree here in Hell Creek. Relatives 
of the Monkey Puzzle Tree, though 
much fuller,  these evergreens 
can reach a staggering height of 
80 meters. Fertile soils seem to 
allow the trees to grow taller here 
than usual.

Liriodendrites
Liriodendrites are by far the 
smallest tree I have seen here. 
Although they are small, they 
hold the first flowers I've seen
since entering Hell Creek. The 
heart shaped leaves on the tree 
are especially interesting to look 
at, especially when surrounded by
needles. I suspect these trees are 
uncommon as they are due to this 
shady redwood canopy. Perhaps 
they will be more common at higher 
elevations where redwoods don't 
grow...

Horsetails
Ranging from 1 to 2 meters, the 
horsetails seem to be the most 
abundant plant here in Hell Creek. 
On my journeys, I've discovered
it is a favorite of Basilemys.

Osmunda
Ranging from 1 to 1 and a half 
meters, Osmunda is a common 
fern here in Hell Creek. These 
large ferns appear to be a tasty 
treat for Triceratops.
