Day 0:
 
While on an expedition, I have
discovered a strange temple in the 
jungle. I have been unable to 
journey in, as night is falling. 
The architecture is unlike any 
structure I've encountered in the 
past. I must set up camp, but I 
will do further investigation 
tomorrow.

Day 1: 

I have taken a stone sample, and 
I must say, it is unlike any stone 
I've seen before. It's hundreds of 
millions of years old! How did it 
get here though? There's no way
any civilization I know of could 
have mined this. I don't even know 
where it would be mined from.
I must go in further.

Day 2: 

There was  a large statue of a 
strange creature, broken down in 
the top of the temple. A glowing 
gem sat in it's chest, almost 
calling to me. It was the 
strangest sensation. Having taken 
it, I saw such incredible things. 
I've inserted this fossil into 
the gem.


Now I must find the gateway...
