Day 4:

I discovered the gateway. Upon
crossing through, I found a very
different world. This place
is lush, with plants that have
been extinct for millions of years.
Moss carpets the ground, and
large animals roam the land. At the
moment, I am unable to confirm
where I am, but I believe this may
be Hell Creek, a formation from the 
American West at the end of the
Cretaceous. I shall do my best to 
document everything I discover
 here.

The Plants of Hell Creek

There seems to be a large variety 
of plant life making up the grand 
forest here. There's at least 
three distinct species of trees, 
and many more species on the 
forest floor.

Metasequoia
Metasequoia seem to be one of the 
largest trees in the area, with 
my predictive measurements 
placing  it anywhere from 60 to 
90 meters tall. It's amazing 
to see the ancestors of the 
modern-day Dawn Redwood,
