##RESEARCH##

research.!FluxRift.text=Scan a Flux Rift
research.!TARShimmerleaf.text=Research Shimmerleaf

card.thaumadditions:base.name=Thaumic Additions
card.thaumadditions:base.text=You study unusual objects around you. Gain from %,d to %,d §lThaumic Additions§r and 1 bonus draw.

research_name.thaumadditions:thaumadds=Thaumic Additions
research_stage.thaumadditions:thaumadds.1=I found very strange theory, that seems to will to help me in my thaumic journey. It seems that I will find obvious things later that I can't think of without this strange observation...
research_stage.thaumadditions:thaumadds.2=I will note this down: Thaumic Additions is a magical expansion to my abilities that wills to help me in many possible ways. And how did I find it again?

research_name.thaumadditions:essence_salt=Salty Vis
research_stage.thaumadditions:essence_salt.1=I was always wondering what vis crystals taste like... Considering that crystals are fragile, they may be easy to crush into salt? According to my theory this may just work...
research_stage.thaumadditions:essence_salt.2=Gah! The salt I just made using my hands was so unstable that it somehow disappeared?! I may need to try once more. For this I will need to jump from a high place on a crystal dropped on the ground.
research_stage.thaumadditions:essence_salt.3=Hm... This salt is much more stable, somehow. And I think each crystal's salt tastes differently! Considering that aspects contain magical powers, could I apply them to my food? <LINE>I will note how to get them: Jump on a dropped vis crystal from hight place.

research_name.thaumadditions:mithrillium=Mithrillium Metal
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithrillium.1=I think I've found an improvement to Void Metal. This new metal not only restores itself faster, it seems to pulsate with high thaumic vibes. I should experiment more, I know that this metal is worth it.
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithrillium.2=Huh! This strange new metal is very unusual, even understanding how void metal works! The book pronounces it's name as "Mithrillium Metal"... I think that it may be a good material to improve my arcane setup. But what exactly can I do with it? Seems like upgrading morphic resonator is easy with it. I am going to bookmark the recipe, perhaps I'll need it in the future?

research_name.thaumadditions:mithminite=Mithminite Metal
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite.1=Adaminite has proven to be a very powerful metal and it is capable of crazy  things such as Adaminite Smeltery. But I think it doesn't reveal it's powers at max. I have an idea about solving that; I may try to fuse it with couple pieces of mithrillium and few drops of quicksilver.
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite.2=My experiment was a success! I've made a new metal that is adaminite, but I can reveal it's full potential. Hm... What should I try to discover with this?

research_name.thaumadditions:adaminite=Adaminite Metal
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite.1=Mithrillium metal is a very strange substance, but I am certain that it could be improved even further. I will try to experiment, and maybe I will be able to know where the best is in this world.
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite.2=My experiments have succeeded! The book calls this new creation as "Adaminite". I'm going crazy now. I heard of Ichor, the blood of Gods, but I think that this metal is far better than Ichor, even if it exists anywhere in this world.

research_name.thaumadditions:mithrillium_smelter=Mithrillium Smeltery
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithrillium_smelter.1=I have a theory about using mithrillium to upgrade my void smeltery. I think that this upgrade will loose less essentia than void one (about 5% loss).
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithrillium_smelter.2=This was definitely worth it! Mithrillium metal seems to keep all slurry in place converting everything without any loss.

research_name.thaumadditions:adaminite_smelter=Adaminite Smeltery
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_smelter.1=Mithrillium smeltery is definitely the best smeltery already. But maybe I could make it extract extra essentia from slurry? I need to experiment with this quite a bit more.
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_smelter.2=Yes! Adaminite seems to work well with efficiency! Adaminite smelter now has a 20% to increase essentia. This means that I may need to do less smelting.

research_name.thaumadditions:mithminite_smelter=Mithminite Smeltery
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_smelter.1=I'd like to improve adaminite smelter's quality and make it faster and produce extra essentia more often. I know that mithminite may help and I need to ensure that I'm thinking right with a little experiment.
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_smelter.2=This new smeltery may be too expensive but I discovered it for 'special' cases. I will make a bookmark on smelter's recipe though.

research_name.thaumadditions:brass_jar=Brass Warded Jars
research_stage.thaumadditions:brass_jar.1=Warded jars are nice and big but they hold only two hundred and fifty essentia inside. I may get a slight increase by upgrading it with brass.
research_stage.thaumadditions:brass_jar.2=I did it! Brass Warded Jar holds a little bit more. It's not significant upgrade but I am sure that this may be upgraded even further.

research_name.thaumadditions:thaumium_jar=Thaumium Reinforced Jars
research_stage.thaumadditions:thaumium_jar.1=Brass is all good and shiny, and it does increase the jar a little bit, but I need a far bigger storage, and I need to make more experiments, maybe with thaumium?
research_stage.thaumadditions:thaumium_jar.2=Worked like a charm! Thaumium Reinforced Jar is a slightly more significant increase in storage. The book says that this new jar holds about three hundred and fifty essentia inside. I actually like where this is going now!

research_name.thaumadditions:eldritch_jar=Void Foritified Jars
research_stage.thaumadditions:eldritch_jar.1=Thaumium may be a good choice for storing liquid essentia more compactly, but I think this may not be enough. I need to experiment with void metal. Who knows what will happen anyway?
research_stage.thaumadditions:eldritch_jar.2=The structure of void metal plate seems to expand storage up to five hundred! I imagine these jars in my laboratory... But they are getting a little bit expensive now, arent they?

research_name.thaumadditions:mithrillium_jar=Mithrillium Reinforced Jars
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithrillium_jar.1=Void metal was a fine choice for storing large quantities of essentia, but the time has come and I need a better storage, again! I remember something about mithrillium being a very ridiculous metal and I definitely remember it being better than void metal. I need to study this further...
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithrillium_jar.2=Upgrading void jar to a mithrillium was definitely worth some time and effort. This new baby holds ten hundred essentia inside wich makes it as ridiculous as primordial pearls! I just can't think of how dense the essentia is stored in such a small place at once!

research_name.thaumadditions:adaminite_jar=Adaminite Foritified Jars
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_jar.1=That mithrillium upgrade was very wonderful, but I think that adaminite may hold essentia better than anything that I know of, as of right now. This may be a bad and also an expensive idea as this may need quite a lot of battling involved.
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_jar.2=Adaminite is very special! I think that this jar may hold twenty hundred points of essentia wich makes this a very dense point in space.
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_jar.3=Adaminite is very special! I think that this jar may hold twenty hundred points of essentia wich makes this a very dense point in space. I hear someone called Zeitheron, one of The Creators who built this world. He whispers that this jar is too dense and may be unstable under special cases: "I don't think that filling it entirely with flux is a good choice...". I can also hear that he is very surprised that I made it as this was a tough challenge that I had done.

research_name.thaumadditions:mithminite_jar=Mithminite Jars
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_jar.1=Now that I know that adaminite may be awakened using mithrillium and some quicksilver, I may need to know if I can afford mithminite jars.
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_jar.2=My theory was true, adaminite jar may be awakened using a complex infusion process involving mithminite alloy, this new (and I hope final) jar holds four thousand essentia wich is twice as much as adaminite jar. I also noticed that this jar destroys excess essentia that flows into it, this may be a very fine upgrade to my old Void Jars AND it doesn't explode from flux overfill.

research_name.thaumadditions:aspect_combiner=Essentia Combining
research_stage.thaumadditions:aspect_combiner.1=I was always wondering if I could undo what a centrifuge does? If that is possible then I would be able to prepare for complex insusion crafting much easier!
research_stage.thaumadditions:aspect_combiner.2=I was experimenting with alchemical centrifuge, mithrillium and phial of permutatio, and I found a way to really mix two aspects to create new aspect. I call this Alchemical Aspect Combiner.

research_name.thaumadditions:aura_charger=Aura Charger
research_stage.thaumadditions:aura_charger.1=I was always wondering if I could replenish aura using alchemy and power of infusion. I will need some Auram aspect and Essentia Combiner to experiment with.
research_stage.thaumadditions:aura_charger.2=Aura Charger is an amazing block that restores vis in aura and caps at almost three times the base aura value. This device uses Auram essentia to restore 10 vis in the environment.

research_name.thaumadditions:crystal_crusher=Crystal Crusher
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_crusher.1=I was wondering if crystal crushing may be automated... I am tired of jumping on a crystal to break it into salt. I will need some mechanisms to experiment with.
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_crusher.2=I accidentally broke Simple Arcane Mechanism but I think that I know a way how to do this! I need to infuse a complex arcane mechanism with all primal crystals, a few thaumium plates, arcane stone slabs and some... salt? It uses Machina from nearby jars to operate.

research_name.thaumadditions:aura_disperser=Aura Disperser
research_stage.thaumadditions:aura_disperser.1=Using salt with food is very useful but I may want to apply this to an area of entities, maybe my farm. I'd love to know more about this...
research_stage.thaumadditions:aura_disperser.2=Aura Disperser is a machine that uses vis salts and applies them to a small area to where it's facing. May be good for many uses, like farms, mob grinders, traps and other things.

research_name.thaumadditions:crystal_bore=Crystal Bore
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_bore.1=I need to mine crystals without destroying one crystal, and I don't see any ways to do this yet... And I also need to automate it, if possible. I will keep studying some golemancy to understand this better.
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_bore.2=I discovered a new device: Crystal Bore! It is capable of mining crystals in front of it at slight cost of vis in nearby aura. It may be disabled using redstone signal, and it can output items to adjacent chest of the back side.

research_name.thaumadditions:crystal_water=Liquid Crystal
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_water.1=My theory is that I could add some aspects to water to make it react to crystal in some way.
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_water.2=Crystal Water is able to speed up the growth of crystal surrounded by eight blocks of this fluid. Each time a crystal grows it MAY consume the water. I will bookmark one of the structures that need to be built.

research_name.thaumadditions:enchanted_golden_apple=Enchanted Golden Apple
research_stage.thaumadditions:enchanted_golden_apple.1=Legents tell that ancient dungeons contain a super enchanted golden apples, sometimes. I think that thaumaturgy can offer a way to make this apple using Desiderium.
research_stage.thaumadditions:enchanted_golden_apple.2=Surprisingly enchanted golden apple is not as expensive as legends tell, probably because I did it differently. I need some desiderium and few golden blocks to enchant normal golden apple.

research_name.thaumadditions:mob_summoning=Entity Recreation
research_stage.thaumadditions:mob_summoning.1=I have a theory of entity recreation that involves vis and a fourth dimension. I need to capture a mob to use it as a 'sample', or a template.
research_stage.thaumadditions:mob_summoning.2=I am slowly progressing through this study. I think that now that I have a way to capture mobs, I will need to recreate them, somehow.
research_stage.thaumadditions:mob_summoning.3=I found how to summon entities using a sample that I can capture using Entity Cell. Now I need to infuse thaumium block with few items and a crap tonn of aspects.

research_name.thaumadditions:puriflower=Puriflower
research_stage.thaumadditions:puriflower.1=I was experimenting with vishrooms and how useless they are, trying to find a use to it. Maybe if combined with shimmerleaf or totem of dawn I may utilize it in aura cleaning, as vishrooms seem to be a powerful source of vis.
research_stage.thaumadditions:puriflower.2=Infusing a totem with vishrooms, shimmerleaf and turning it all alive, along with auram, herba, imperium and ordo results in a quite different plant: Puriflower. It has very special ability: slowly absorb flux from aura. I will note, however: They absorb flux a bit slower than totems do, but when they do, the amount of flux taken is much more, and it doesn't malfunction. If I place a lot of them, then dealing with flux won't be a problem, and flux rifts will either appear much more rare, or not appear at all!

research_name.thaumadditions:crystal_block=Crystal Blocks
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_block.1=I was thinking of a way of placing crystals as decorative blocks in my house. I may need to use arcane workbench in order to channel vis properly.
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_block.2=My clues were true! Channeling vis into 9 crystals can create a shape that is similar to a crystal. I think that these can replace the old crystal clusters that my parents used before.

research_name.thaumadditions:growth_chamber=Crystal Growth Chamber
research_stage.thaumadditions:growth_chamber.1=Growing crystals was my dream, it was proven to be possible by farming crystals, but I know that this is not the most efficient and fastest way out there. I need to put some things and research the property of crystal's block, and perhaps I will find something new...
research_stage.thaumadditions:growth_chamber.2=Of course! I managed to create a very special device that can easily recreate any crystal, even those made by me in the crucible. I just need to place the growth chamber in a saturated on vis place, then put crystals together to create a crystal cluster, then provide the chamber with the cluster, give it some vis of the same type. Then the chamber will start to deplete aura and produce a crystal.

research_name.thaumadditions:seal=Arcane Seals
research_stage.thaumadditions:seal.1=I am thinking of some sort of arcane base that will allow to replace golems in sort of a way.. I just need it to continue thinking about how to do that.
research_stage.thaumadditions:seal.2=Seems like gold with wool is good enough for what I will do in the future. Now all I need is something magical enough to attach to this seal. Seems like it has about three slots for whatever I will attach onto it.

research_name.thaumadditions:seal_symbols=Seal Symbology
research_stage.thaumadditions:seal_symbols.1=That seal seems to go with somewhat round objects... Now I am thinking of using vis crystals in this setup along with some gold.. maybe?
research_stage.thaumadditions:seal_symbols.2=Alright! Seems like I'm on the right way.. I think. Using vis crystal to channel the magic powers of the crystal's type and gold to focus it onto the seal seem to fit the seal design. And I think the amount of possible combinations is overwhelming, but I think that most of them are pointless.

research_name.thaumadditions:totems=Totemancy
research_stage.thaumadditions:totems.1=I think that flux rifts absorb flux from my aura at a slow rate. I may be able to connect to the other dimension they are dumping it in, and somehow bring it back. Don't know why, but why not?
research_stage.thaumadditions:totems.2=After studying the rift better I managed to create a weaker version of it that brings flux back from the other dimensions, at a very slow rate. I think that the connection is unstable by itself thus it may generate large dumps of flux rarely. The book calls this phenomen 'Twilight Totem'<LINE>Though this wasn't what I need. I may need to research shimmerleaf's properties a bit more.
research_stage.thaumadditions:totems.3=After studying the rift better I managed to create a weaker version of it that brings flux back from the other dimensions, at a very slow rate. I think that the connection is unstable by itself thus it may generate large dumps of flux rarely. The book calls this phenomen 'Twilight Totem'<LINE>Yes, my theory was right. Shimmerleafs can be improved into somewhat more promising. The result is the new totem of dawn. I think it acts quite like a rift, but it's stable and reliable, mostly?

research_name.thaumadditions:seal_globe=Seal Peeking
research_stage.thaumadditions:seal_globe.1=Seals are great and all, but I need to know what the setup on the seal does. I think vis resonator has a clue to what I need.
research_stage.thaumadditions:seal_globe.2=I applied some magic to vis resonator and now it's similar to a globe. This thing is capable of telling me what the seal does.

research_name.thaumadditions:arcane_cake=Arcane Cake
research_stage.thaumadditions:arcane_cake.1=I was wondering about cake's natural abilities, and how I could improve them. I might be onto something that can once and for all fix my problem with food.
research_stage.thaumadditions:arcane_cake.2=Using some primordial magic I think I can make the cake slowly regenerate itself. Not only that, I can also apply some vis salt, but it seems to turn into a vis sugar when I do that.

research_name.thaumadditions:knowledge_tome=Tome of Sharing
research_stage.thaumadditions:knowledge_tome.1=Something quite useful when I play with my friends would be some kind of a book that stores all everything known by me. I will need to develop this idea a bit further.
research_stage.thaumadditions:knowledge_tome.2=An empty Thaumonomicon serves a perfect base to write all my knowledge. Not only it seems to continue expanding when I write down more, but it remains as compact.
research_stage.thaumadditions:knowledge_tome.2_noreuse=An empty Thaumonomicon serves a perfect base to write all my knowledge. Not only it seems to continue expanding when I write down more, but it remains as compact. Though I suspect that after someone reads it, the tome would poof out of existance in a blink of an eye. Very sad fact, actually.

research_name.thaumadditions:fragnant_pendant=Sane on the go!
research_stage.thaumadditions:fragnant_pendant.1=My current ways of fighting against warp controlling my mind is simple: have a bath in purifying fluid. This effect lasts for a while. But what if I go on a journey? I need to thing of that more...
research_stage.thaumadditions:fragnant_pendant.2=From what I see, I can make fancy amulet into a pendant that, when worn, will emit a sanitizing aroma by dispersing odour powder. I think that this way is much better and I can go wherever I want to!

research_name.thaumadditions:chester=Chester
research_stage.thaumadditions:chester.1=Since I travel a lot, keeping my inventory relatively empty is bloody hard. It might be interesting to animate my hungry chest and program it in a way that he will follow me...
research_stage.thaumadditions:chester.2=Seems like greatwood and thaumium isn't enough. But adding morphic resonator and zombie brains seem to imbue the chest with cognitive abilities. Add some aspects and I get what I was expecting - Chester. It seems that I will need some kind of tool, attuning it to thaumium seems a rather good idea. Bone-eye that is, it will work perfectly for what it was invented for.

research_name.thaumadditions:vis_seeds=Growing Essentia
research_stage.thaumadditions:vis_seeds.1=Any thaumaturge while performing magic needs essentia of some kind. In most cases however said essentia needs to be obtained from physical objects like items. I will take it a step further and try to fuse a mundane wheat seed with magic...
research_stage.thaumadditions:vis_seeds.2=Crucible seems to do the job. Throwing seeds with some herba and a bit more other essentia of any kind seem to infuse wheat seed and change it's genes. This makes it much harder to get more plantables after gathering one, but this is definitely something that may come in use for farming rare essentia.

research_name.thaumadditions:flux_concentrator=Flux Concentrator
research_stage.thaumadditions:flux_concentrator.1=Some plants that I've found in world seem to be imbued with magic. For example, Vishroom. Sometimes one may need a lot of these rare mushrooms. I need to study gaseous flux; perhaps this may give me some hints?
research_stage.thaumadditions:flux_concentrator.2=To make gaseous flux I need a machine called "Flux Concentrator". Seems like it needs to be supplied with §5Vitium§r essentia from one side, and using it's bellows it will spit the gaseous flux from the opposite side. It's pressure is enough to travel around sixteen blocks from the concentrator.

research_name.thaumadditions:vis_scribing_tools=Vis Scribing Tools
research_stage.thaumadditions:vis_scribing_tools.1=Sometimes the most annoying thing while I do is scribing tools suddenly running out of ink. This is so frustrating! Next time I'm going to need a bigger and better tools...
research_stage.thaumadditions:vis_scribing_tools.2=Seems like tuning mundane scribing tools with crystals of praecantatio and a little bit of auram essentia in small glass capsule did a fascinating job! Vis Scribing Tools seem to be rechargable on a §lRecharge Pedestal§r, and these tools hold for a little longer.

research_name.thaumadditions:adaminite_fabric=Adaminite Fabric
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_fabric.1=Adaminite metal can be very soft, hard or even dissolving. What would happen if I mix it with enchanted fabric?..
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_fabric.2=The result seems to be pretty inefficient. From eight fabric I got only two, but this new cloth is very flexible. It is also a pretty good material for wearing - so soft, and seems unbreakable.

research_name.thaumadditions:mithminite_fabric=Mithminite Fabric
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_fabric.1=After getting mithminite, I wonder how my adaminite fabric can be further upgraded. Maybe try mixing it with new mithminite metal?
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_fabric.2=Okay, this time I got same amount of mithminite fabric from less adaminite one. It doesn't seem like I could make myself a wearing from it... that easily, at least... I need to study this phenomen a bit more.

research_name.thaumadditions:mithminite_hood=Mithminite Hood
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_hood.1=I'm thinking of upgrading my adaminite helmet with the new mithminite cloth. Seems like infusion would help me.
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_hood.2=Woah, the infusion I need to do to get mithminite hood is pretty complex, it seems. I was able to infuse few useful things into the helmet, so it has a few 'abilities': Water breathing, night vision, sanity checker, fragrant pendant... and... Tool repairer! No more do I need this silly mending enchantment, my helmet is going to repair any tools in my hand when I pickup experience. Seems like looking at the seal with this hood on I can see what the seal does...

research_name.thaumadditions:mithminite_robe=Mithminite Robe
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_robe.1=Perhaps it's the time to upgrade adaminite robe... I wonder what can I fuse with it and how it could be improved with mithminite fabric?
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_robe.2=Mithminite Robe seems to be infused with life and a few other aspects hence it has a few awesome abilities: Flight, Additional Health, Movement Speed, Fire Resistance.

research_name.thaumadditions:mithminite_belt=Mithminite Belt
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_belt.1=I suppose my belt can be upgraded as well... I don't think that I will be able to put much things into it, but it will do the trick, still.
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_belt.2=And... yeah, this piece is not as powerful as some of it's mithminite alternatives, but it is still there, and I suppose it has a better vis discount, also giving me fast speed.

research_name.thaumadditions:mithminite_boots=Mithminite Boots
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_boots.1=My final part of armor would be boots... Why not to combine it with Boots of the Traveller? I don't really have any other ideas of what can be added to them.
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_boots.2=Great! I think that my Boots of the Traveller fused within mithminite boots seem to work without need to be constantly recharged.

research_name.thaumadditions:void_thaumometer=Void Thaumometer
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_thaumometer.1=After discovering the power of flux rifts, making void metal and going a bit insane I think I might finally be able to know more about flux rifts...
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_thaumometer.2=Noted! Flux rifts have a stability that can be measured by how much void metal reacts to them. So if I replace golden frame from my thaumometer with void metal, it should do the trick...

research_name.thaumadditions:wormhole_mirror=Wormhole Mirror
research_stage.thaumadditions:wormhole_mirror.1=I was wondering how I could stabilize and expand the thin connection between magic mirrors, so I could pass through them... Studying void metal does bring some hints, but I need a bit of additional thinking...
research_stage.thaumadditions:wormhole_mirror.2=Okay, I have found a way to expand connections between magic mirrors... using a... 'wormhole'? Whatever that is, I really want to test it out, but then I think I'm going crazy... Using a thaumometer (as a connection catcher), a bit of void plates onto the hand mirror seem to get me a Wormhole Mirror... Though, how does it work? Perhaps I should use it on a bound mirror?..

research_name.thaumadditions:void_crop=Growing Void
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_crop.1=Void seeds have a wonderful ability to regenerate. But could this matter be directed to cloning these rare seeds?
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_crop.2=Infusing void seeds with primordial energies have enabled me to make the seed plantable. I'll need a complex and long infusion process to get it done.

research_name.thaumadditions:essentia_pistol=Essentia Pistol
research_stage.thaumadditions:essentia_pistol.1=Dispersing salts is nice, but not very applicable in rather unexpected situations I might end up in. Making it portable would be a key requirement to success.
research_stage.thaumadditions:essentia_pistol.2=Using aura disperser as an accelerator is a smart decision. Essentia Pistol would be definitely the best option I could think of. Thaumium would help the essentia travel through the tube safer. I would require something that can hold liquid essentia - something that I already use when infusing items on runic matrix.

research_name.thaumadditions:shadow_enchanter=Shadow Enchanter
research_stage.thaumadditions:shadow_enchanter.1=There are quite a few ways of infusing tools, weapons and armor with mundane magic, but it is very unstable and occasional. I'll invest the phenomen of enchanting a bit further, to, perhaps, push the limits a bit further.
research_stage.thaumadditions:shadow_enchanter.2=As it turned out, mithrillium not only allows to stabilize the enchating process and make it more predictable, but with some resonators attached, I might be able to select exactly what I need. Additional bonus of this all is xp-free enchanting! All I need now is only some essentia nearby. To start the process one's going to need to select all desired enchantments and activate the Shadow Enchanter with Caster's Gauntlet.

research_name.thaumadditions:shadow_beam_staff=Shadow Beam Staff
research_stage.thaumadditions:shadow_beam_staff.1=Mithrillium holds so much power, that I could probably focus it into a beam!
research_stage.thaumadditions:shadow_beam_staff.2=Using vis resonator with mithrillium allows to harness the Alienis into a powerful laser. To charge it, I would need to use Essentia Sink to fill it up with Alienis essentia. Strangely enough, the laser seem to bounce from any surfaces that it hits.

research_name.thaumadditions:void_anvil=Void Anvil
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_anvil.1=Sometimes mundane anvils don't take long to break, that may be a bit frustrating. After studying void metal, I might try to cover the anvil with void metal. Perhaps that may improve lifespan of them!
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_anvil.2=Void metal seems to never stop impressing me, huh! I think this dark new anvil is pretty much infinite. But in exchance of damaging itself, it seems that every hit it gets, the aura pollutes by a little. I am going to need to be more careful next time!

research_name.thaumadditions:disenchant_fabric=Fabric of Disenchantment
research_stage.thaumadditions:disenchant_fabric.1=Enchanting items with mundane tools can be quite hard to alter, I will need a tool to let me take these enchantments and cast them back to (some) experience. Perhaps rubbing my tools with something soft yet magical?
research_stage.thaumadditions:disenchant_fabric.2=Enchanted Fabric along with salis mundus seem to provide a good and semi-reliable way of taking off the enchantments that I may have. The only catch here is the durability: the fabric seems to vanish after about 30 attempts. What a pain!

research_name.thaumadditions:crystal_bag=Crystal Bag
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_bag.1=Inventory problems can get quite annoying something, especially with all these crystals! I wonder if I could link foci pouches that to store crystals somehow...
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_bag.2=The pure crystals may not work, but it appears to me that natural crystals can attune the pouch to accept any crystal. Also, I think I may have opened a black hole of some kind!..

research_name.thaumadditions:blue_wolf=Blue Wolf
research_stage.thaumadditions:blue_wolf=Blue Wolves cannot be found. Their fur color seems very unnatural. Everything about them reminds me of that one thing... Anyway, these wolves are a good source of blue fur. It might be worth researching! It appears that these animals only come with male gender, thus cannot be bred.

research_name.thaumadditions:the_beheader=The Beheader
research_stage.thaumadditions:the_beheader.1=Every trip to the nether annoys me. Running around the fortress exhausting yourself and looking everywhere to find wither skeletons, hoping to get their skulls. Perhaps I should stop smashing those piles of bones and be actually careful enough to harvest black skulls?
research_stage.thaumadditions:the_beheader.2=Beheading seems like the way to go here. Improving on my thaumium axe would be an excellent idea - it fuses quite well with mithrillium. The new Beheader is lighter than an average axe, and has a good damage, so this may be used when I'm out of swords again.

research_name.thaumadditions:adaminite_sword=Adaminite Sword
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_sword.1=While void metals posesses amazing powers, I have gone far in it's hierarchy, and I am confident that an upgrade to it is worthy.
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_sword.2=Adaminite fuses well with it's own component, that's pretty smart. Though since adaminite is hard to apply, a lot of auxiliary essentia may be required. Adding some primal energy to it also makes this weapong a pretty much the best melee weapon any thaumaturge may posess. Or is it?

research_name.thaumadditions:mithminite_scythe=Mithminite Scythe
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_scythe.1=Mithminite has proven to be quite important in few ways, but perhaps a tool could be made out of it?
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_scythe.2=Unfortunately, just putting Mithminite on a tool handle is a bad idea - all rods that I've tried break very fast... Though it seems like making the entire tool out of mithminite with help of some auxiliary materials is possible, and the result may be a bit more deadly then I expected... Somehow the new scythe is able to shoot with phantom scythes that are also a bit more strong then mine. Oh well, might as well go and murder some enemies.

research_name.thaumadditions:void_elemental_hoe=Void Hoe of Growth
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_elemental_hoe.1=Researching void metal have hinted me at just how much void metal can restore by itself. What would happen if I upgrade my hoe of growth with it?
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_elemental_hoe.2=I wasn't able to attach void metal to the hoe, but I think that with some primordial energy it might be quite possible. "Void Hoe of Growth" is essentially the same as my Hoe of Growth, but it also restores itself using a little help from aura.

research_name.thaumadditions:void_elemental_shovel=Void Shovel of the Earthmover
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_elemental_shovel.1=Digging out large patches of earth may be easier with shovel of the Earthmover, but sadly it is still no that durable. Surely void metal can be infused into an elemental shovel with a little help from outside this world...
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_elemental_shovel.2=Using the primordial pearl to merge my shovel with void metal gave a pretty fascinating result. The new void shovel of the Earthmover is now capable of using aura every so often to last longer, or forever. Really depends on how intensively I use it though.

research_name.thaumadditions:void_elemental_pickaxe=Void Pickaxe of the Core
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_elemental_pickaxe.1=Mining is a chore that requires a lot of tools at all times. Pickaxe of the Core may not be as sturdy as some other materials, but some of it's other perks make it still a better solution. I am sure that the durability problem can be solved with a little trickery with void metal.
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_elemental_pickaxe.2=This seems wrong.. I think something went wrong, and getting this new Void pickaxe of the Core needs a hefty amount of Metallum. I suppose it may be because the pickaxe itself is very sensitive to metal?

research_name.thaumadditions:void_elemental_axe=Void Axe of the Stream
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_elemental_axe.1=Cutting down forests of trees has been easier with Axe of the Stream due to it's ability to destroy the entire trunk. I may need to come up with an upgrade to make it a lot tougher. I am sure that using my beloved void metal is the way here!
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_elemental_axe.2=Putting together the usual primordial formula for infusing tools with void metal is not too hard, I think. What I know for sure, this is definitely a worthy upgrade as long as used properly.

research_name.thaumadditions:traveller_belt=Belt of the Traveller
research_stage.thaumadditions:traveller_belt.1=After discovering Boots of the Traveller, they became crucial for the exploration of new land. Though sometimes one could stumble across mobs, and the boots are bad at protecting their wearer.
research_stage.thaumadditions:traveller_belt.2=Seems like infusing the mundane belt with the same ritual as done with my boots, I can make myself a fancy new Belt of the Traveller. It's function seems absolutely identical, but it is a belt, thus much more portable.

research_name.thaumadditions:striding_belt=Striding Belt
research_stage.thaumadditions:striding_belt.1=Surely the all new and shiny Belt of the Traveller was a really good uplift from old fashioned boots, but should be possible to upgrade a little bit further.
research_stage.thaumadditions:striding_belt.2=Striding Belt seems to be a pretty sensible outcome of fusing the old belt with a lot of Aer and Motus essentia with some ember and feathers. This belt is capable of making leaps never seen before, while also increasing my walk speed slightly.

research_name.thaumadditions:meteor_belt=Belt of the Meteor
research_stage.thaumadditions:meteor_belt.1=I'm unsure if this is a rational move or not, but I *may* need another upgrade to the belt I currently possess... It's quite chaotic, sure, but I still need it!
research_stage.thaumadditions:meteor_belt.2=Belt of the Meteor is an explosive succeess... Quite literally. It's not as safe, and can cause harm to living beings if I am not careful enough with it. Infusing old belt with lots of Ignis and Motus, I've made a beast of a belt, that is surely at it's peak of power.
