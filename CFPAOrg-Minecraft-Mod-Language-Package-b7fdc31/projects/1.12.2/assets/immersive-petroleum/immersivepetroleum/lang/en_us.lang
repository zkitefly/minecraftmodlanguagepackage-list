ie.manual.entry.distillationTower.name=Distillation Tower
ie.manual.entry.distillationTower.subtext=Environmentally unfriendly
ie.manual.entry.distillationTower0=The Distillation Tower is a large multiblock structure that separates crude oil into a number of byproducts. It is built as shown and formed by using the Engineering's Hammer on the Redstone Engineering Block.<br><br>Crude Oil can be input into the Distillation Tower at the back hatch marked with a blue dot, where it will be heated until it separates into a number of layers. This produces a variety of fluids and has a chance to produce Bitumen as a byproduct.
ie.manual.entry.distillationTower1=The Distillation Tower uses <config;i;distillationTower_operationCost> Flux per operation, converting up to 25 mB of Crude Oil to Diesel, Lubricant, Gasoline, and Bitumen per tick. The produced fluid mix is output from the side hatch marked with an orange dot; the Bitumen through the front hatch.<br><br>Diesel can be used for <link;dieselgen;§o§npower §o§nproduction§r>, Lubricant for <link;lubricant;§o§noiling §o§nmachines§r>, and Gasoline for <link;portableGenerator;§o§npowering §o§nengines§r> <link;speedboat;§o§nvehicles§r>, or <link;napalm;§o§nNapalm§r>. Bitumen is used to make <link;asphalt;§o§nAsphalt§r>.
ie.manual.entry.distillationTower2=Below are the operations the Distillation Tower can perform:

ie.manual.entry.pumpjack.name=Pumpjack
ie.manual.entry.pumpjack.subtext=Pump, pump it up
ie.manual.entry.pumpjack0=The Pumpjack is a multiblock that extracts Crude Oil from deposits situated underneath bedrock. The structure is formed by using the Engineering's Hammer on the Heavy Engineering Block on the second layer.
ie.manual.entry.pumpjack1=The Pumpjack Tower uses <config;i;pumpjack_consumption> Flux/t to pump Crude Oil at a rate of <config;i;pumpjack_speed> mB/t. The produced oil is automatically ejected through the two side ports with orange dots.<br><br>The average Oil deposit will take <config;i;pumpjack_days> days to deplete, though adding more Pumpjacks can speed the process.<br><br>Applying a redstone signal to the control panel will halt the machine's process, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Engineer's Hammer.

ie.manual.entry.oil.name=Fluid Reservoirs
ie.manual.entry.oil.subtext=Black gold
ie.manual.entry.oil0=While mining near bedrock, you've occasionally noticed a slick black flammable substance: oil. Oil is just one of many fluids that can be found underneath the impenetrable rock, but you won't be able to breach these reserves on your own.<br><br>With the help of a <link;pumpjack;§o§nspecially §o§ndesigned §o§nmachine§r> you may be able to get your hands on the contents of these reservoirs.
ie.manual.entry.oil1=The <link;minerals;§o§nCore §o§nSample §o§nDrill§r> will determine whether a reservoir can be found in a specific chunk and gives insight into the size of the fluid deposit.<br><br>Despite the finite volume of fluid in each chunk, certain types of reservoirs may have trace amounts of fluid that can still be harvested after the chunk is depleted. Using more than one Pumpjack in a depleted chunk does not provide any benefit.
ie.manual.entry.oil2=%1$s %6$s<br>It contains %3$s to %4$s mB of %2$s.%5$s

ie.manual.entry.oilBiomeAny=This reservoir will generate in any Biome.

ie.manual.entry.asphalt.name=Asphalt Concrete
ie.manual.entry.asphalt.subtext=Highway material
ie.manual.entry.asphalt0=Asphalt Concrete, held together by gooey Bitumen, is a darker colored alternative to regular Concrete. It may be produced using the byproducts of processing Crude Oil in the <link;distillationTower;§n§oDistillation §n§oTower§r>. 

ie.manual.entry.schematics.name=Multiblock Projector
ie.manual.entry.schematics.subtext=Invaluable instructions
ie.manual.entry.schematics0=When it comes to building large multiblock structures, referring to your Engineer's Manual time and time again has grown tedious. By crafting a primitive projector device, you believe you can project schematics of these structures into the world to use as a template.
ie.manual.entry.schematics1=If you turn your Engineer's Manual to the page of a multiblock structure and then place it in a crafting bench alongside a Projector, you can set the internal slide to match that multiblock. The Projector will then act as a three dimensional building guide.
ie.manual.entry.schematics2=Holding a Projector will display the structure. Pressing the pick block button will rotate the structure, and sneaking while doing so will mirror it. Right clicking will lock the image in place, where it will show as long as the Projector is in your hotbar.<br><br>Sneaking and right clicking with a projector that has a locked image will unlock the image.<br><br>In Creative mode, sneaking while locking the image will build the multiblock automatically.

ie.manual.entry.speedboat.name=Motorboat
ie.manual.entry.speedboat.subtext=Wave rider
ie.manual.entry.speedboat0=You can now travel the seas at high speed with the help of the Motorboat. The Motorboat runs off of <link;distillationTower;§n§oGasoline§r> which may be added with a bucket or <link;jerrycan;§n§oJerrycan§r>. Gasoline is consumed while driving the Motorboat forwards or backwards. Holding the jump key will increase the speed of the boat, albeit at the cost of higher fuel consumption and increased turn radius.
ie.manual.entry.speedboat1=Like other devices, the Motorboat can be modified in the <link;workbench;§o§nEngineer's §o§nWorkbench§r>.<br><br>The §6Expanded Fuel Tank§r allows the Motorboat to hold twice the amount of fuel.
ie.manual.entry.speedboat2=A set of §6Maneuvering Rudders§r gives the Motorboat the ability to change direction much more quickly, drastically improving handling. With this upgrade, the boat's turning radius is impressively lowered.
ie.manual.entry.speedboat3=Navigation through colder climates becomes a trivial task with the §6Icebreaker Bow§r, which allows the Motorboat to ram through ice. In addition to its mobility benefits, the Bow allows the Motorboat to damage monsters that it runs into.
ie.manual.entry.speedboat4=If you seek to explore beyond this realm, or simply wish to make your Motorboat more resistant to the elements, consider installing a §6Reinforced Hull§r. The steel hull grants both increased health and fire resistance to the boat, allowing for navigation of the Nether's vast lava lakes.
ie.manual.entry.speedboat5=Equipping your Motorboat with a pair of §6Emergency Paddles§r means that running out of fuel is no longer the disaster it once was. If the fuel tank on the boat is empty, you can paddle it like a traditional rowboat.

ie.manual.entry.lubricant.name=Lubricant
ie.manual.entry.lubricant.subtext=Slip and slide
ie.manual.entry.lubricant0=Nobody's machines are perfect, not even your own. Inevitable friction between moving parts stops your devices from working to their maximum capacity - that's where Lubricant comes in. It will ensure a connected machine will run at full throttle, <config;d;autoLubricant_speedup>x its base speed. <link;pumpjack;§n§oPumpjacks§r>, <link;excavator;§n§oExcavators§r>, and <link;crusher;§n§oCrushers§r> can all be lubricated.
ie.manual.entry.lubricant1=The Lubricant Can can be used to manually apply a lubricating fluid to a machine. Petroleum Lubricant is the most effective, but <link;squeezer;§n§oPlant Oil§r> also works. Once the can is full, simply right click on a valid block to lubricate it. While sped up, the machine will visibly drip.
ie.manual.entry.lubricant2=Iron Golems may also be lubricated, healing them and temporarily increasing their speed and strength.<br><br>A <link;chemthrower;§o§nChemical §o§nThrower§r> can also be used to apply a lubricant to blocks, albeit less efficiently. Simply spray a valid lubricant fluid onto a machine and it will begin to operate at full speed.

ie.manual.entry.automaticLubricator.name=Automatic Lubricator
ie.manual.entry.automaticLubricator.subtext=Hands free
ie.manual.entry.automaticLubricator0=Manually applying <link;distillationTower;§n§oLubricant§r> to machines can be tiring and often frustrating. The Automatic Lubricator will do this task for you once attached to a machine. The point where it must be attached is highlighted while holding a lubricator in your hand.
ie.manual.entry.automaticLubricator1=When correctly placed, lubricating pipes will form around the machine. At this point, simply supply Petroleum Lubricant or <link;squeezer;§n§oPlant Oil§r>.

ie.manual.entry.portableGenerator.name=Portable Generator
ie.manual.entry.portableGenerator.subtext=Gassed up
ie.manual.entry.portableGenerator0=The Portable Generator is a mobile all-in-one power solution. This <link;distillationTower;§n§oGasoline§r>-fueled engine-generator produces up to <config;i;portableGenerator_flux> Flux/t while running, and has an internal power buffer of 100,000 RF.
ie.manual.entry.portableGenerator1=The Portable Generator can accept fuel by simply right clicking with a bucket. Gasoline or other fuel can also be piped in from above. Power is output directly through LV or MV wires, Connectors are not needed. Applying a redstone signal will halt generation.<br><br>Sneaking and right clicking on the generator will pick it up, preserving all stored power and fuel.

ie.manual.entry.napalm.name=Napalm
ie.manual.entry.napalm.subtext=Beware the River God
ie.manual.entry.napalm0=Napalm is an extremely flammable substance that can be created in the <link;mixer;§n§oMixer§r> using <link;distillationTower;§n§oGasoline§r> and three measures of Aluminium Grit. It has little use other than wanton destruction; when Napalm is lit, fire will spread almost immediately over its surface, allowing for rapid deforestation. In addition, it can serve as a very effective fuel for the <link;chemthrower;§n§oChemthrower§r>.
