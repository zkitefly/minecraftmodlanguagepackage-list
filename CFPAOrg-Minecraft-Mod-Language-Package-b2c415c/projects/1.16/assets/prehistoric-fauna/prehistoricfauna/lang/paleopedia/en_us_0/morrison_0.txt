Day ???
Upon finding a fossil from the 
Jurassic, I've attempted to 
re-enter the portal. Crossing 
through, I've found myself in a hot 
and dry place, where a great bowl 
of blue sky surrounds me. The 
fauna and flora I can see in the 
region make me believe I have 
entered the Morrison formation 
from the Jurassic period. This 
portal must be studied further.
For now, I will do as I did in Hell 
Creek, and begin an investigation 
of the local fauna and flora, 
recording everything I can. I have 
given up on keeping track of 
time though. The days have begun 
to all blur together.

Plants of the Morrison

Araucaria
Like Hell Creek, Araucaria seems to 
be somewhat abundant here, 
although much smaller. I wonder 
how much older this species of 
the tree is?

Protopiceoxylon
This is the other type of sturdy 
tree in the region. Growing up to 
25 meters tall, these trees are 
fully extinct by the modern-day. 
They seem to prefer the dryer 
regions of this savanna. It's truly 
fascinating to see them. Their 
wood is extremely beautiful.
