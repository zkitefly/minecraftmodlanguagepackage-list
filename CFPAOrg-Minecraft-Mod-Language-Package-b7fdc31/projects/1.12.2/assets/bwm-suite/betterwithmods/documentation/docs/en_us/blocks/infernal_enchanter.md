Infernal Enchanter is an advanced enchanter which allows you to select specific enchantments before Enchanting.
This device requires a large library for the enchanting of items. It can use any bookshelf (or other magical enchanting sources) within a 17x17x17[^1] centered around the Infernal Enchanter
With this library and  an [Arcane Scrolls](../items/arcane_scrolls.md) one can choose any available level for that enchant when given enough books.
As more enchantments are applied to one item, the cost increases and thus requires more bookshelves.
