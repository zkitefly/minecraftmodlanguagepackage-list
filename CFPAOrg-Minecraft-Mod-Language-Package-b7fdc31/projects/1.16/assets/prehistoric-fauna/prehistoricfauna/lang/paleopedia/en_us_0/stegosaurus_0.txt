On my first day, I've already 
discovered a herd of Stegosaurus, 
with some Dryosaurus mingling 
about. These large beasts are 
truly majestic, and their low 
gurgles reverberate through me. 
Their four thagomizers are large, 
and I'll have to be careful. One 
swing from their tail, and it could 
kill me. I will have to find a 
way to study them while keeping a 
distance.

Besides the Dryosaurus, it seems 
most dinosaurs tend to stay away 
from the Stegosaurus, excluding 
the Allosaurus, who hunt them, 
and the Camarasaurus, who are too 
big to care. I've also noticed that 
the Stegosaurus are eating the 
leaves from the Zamites, which 
are too tall for the Dryosaurus 
to reach.
