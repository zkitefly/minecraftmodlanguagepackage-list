Day 12:

After a good while of further
exploration in the more lightly
wooded areas, I've found what
seems to be Triceratops!
	
These giants were grazing
around in the fern-covered
underbrush, I didn't want 
to go too close, as I'd expect 
them to act territorial, since 
I've spotted infants in the small 
group.

I also spotted some
Thescelosaurus stick around
the group, possibly seeking shelter
from the local predators.

Day 37:
After a long time of research
and wait, I finally had the chance
to steal a triceratops egg, which
I placed in a comfortable pillow
made out of dried ferns and
horsetails. I waited weeks
for it to hatch and it worked!
The infant was tiny,
and differed from its
adult counterparts greatly.
I made sure it would feed
normally and grow up to be
healthy and strong.
