Place a row of Quartz Slabs in a row 4x long along the top-Step 3: One block along place Flawless Glass 2x high on either side, place 4x Quartz slabs on top and then repeat until you reach your desired length-Step 4: Do the same thing you did at the other end but instead of the Greenhouse and Carbon Dioxide Generator place a Stable Stone or if you want to build a crazy greenhouse you can place a Flawless Greenhouse and Carbon Dioxide Generator in the same way to create a double ended greenhouse-Step 5: Insert Energy into Greenhouse-Step 6: The Carbon Dioxide Generator then needs to be setup...-Step 7: Place a chest/storage system behind the Greenhouse otherwise Items will start spewing on the floor! Like with the Basic & Advanced Greenhouse-Be warned this Greenhouse is rapid. Makes sure you have plenty of Storage Ready!

info.CarbonDioxideGenerator.name=Works in a similar way to the Gas Lanterns and can keep the greenhouses CO2 at 100%-Unlike the gas lanterns this block requires RF/EU-You will have to find a fuel that sustains your size of greenhouse. However there is a new special type of fuel called the “Controlling Fuel”, this fuel manages its own burn time when in the Carbon Dioxide generator and keeps the Greenhouse at optimal level without using up burn time constantly. To create this fuel you will need to look into Circuit Extraction and more specifically the Precision Chamber to extract the circuits you need for the controlling fuel.
