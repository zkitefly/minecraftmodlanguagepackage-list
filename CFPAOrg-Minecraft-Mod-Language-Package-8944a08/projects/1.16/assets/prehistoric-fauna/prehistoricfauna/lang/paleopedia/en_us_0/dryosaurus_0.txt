My first day here in the Morrison, 
and I've already encountered a 
group of Dryosaurus! Staying near 
a herd of Stegosaurus for 
protection, these agile dinosaurs 
are quite interesting to watch. 
When spooked, they bolt faster 
than I could possibly imagine. 
Their bodies help them blend in 
with the dirty landscape as well.

While exploring today, I discovered 
bite marks on the Coniopteris 
surrounding me. I have concluded, 
due to the size of the marks, that 
it must have been Dryosaurus. I 
was also able to catch several 
Dryosaurus nesting nearby, using 
the plant to help build their nest.
