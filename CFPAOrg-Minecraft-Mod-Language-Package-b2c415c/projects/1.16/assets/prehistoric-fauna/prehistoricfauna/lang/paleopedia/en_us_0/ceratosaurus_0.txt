While moving along a river today, 
I spotted two Ceratosaurus! Their 
coloration is quite beautiful, 
although it made them easy for me 
to spot. Their large horn and eye 
ridges make them a very 
interesting sight to see.

They seem to live near this river, 
as I saw them again today. This 
time, they had a Dryosaurus corpse 
nearby for their dinner. Their 
muscular legs allow them to chase 
after and catch the agile 
Dryosaurus. I will have to be 
careful not to catch their 
attention.
