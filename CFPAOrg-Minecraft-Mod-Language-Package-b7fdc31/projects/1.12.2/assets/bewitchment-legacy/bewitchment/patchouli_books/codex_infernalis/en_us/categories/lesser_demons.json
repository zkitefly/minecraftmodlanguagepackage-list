  "description": "Lesser Demons are residents of the Hellish Realms that have at least a human-level of intelligence. They are known to interact with mortals, but often in ways that are for the Demonâ€™s own benefit. When not tormenting mortals, Lesser Demons are known to wage war upon each other in order to claim the most souls.",
