# Intro
va.guide.entry.intro.page1=Welcome to VanillaAutomation!\nThis mod adds blocks and tweaks to the dispenser to allow for automation without making it too easy.\nTake a look at the different entries to see what is added and changed.

# Credits
va.guide.entry.credits.page1=VanillaAutomation\nby universal\n\nThis mod  wouldn't have been possible without other open-source mods.\nSpecial thanks to:\nPahimar\nAmadornes\nVazkii\nThe Forge Team\nand all contributors

# Blockplacer
va.guide.entry.blockplacer.page1=The block placer can, as it's name suggests, place blocks in the world. It'll also right-click with any items at the position it would normally place things at.\nYou can change the facing and the placing distance in the gui.
va.guide.entry.blockplacer.page2=§oSteve in a box§r

# Dispenser
va.guide.entry.dispenser.page1=With VanillaAutomation installed the dispenser receives a few tweaks to allow it to automate things.\nThe following things are new:\nPlacing any vanilla tool in the dispenser allows it to break blocks.\nDye will dye any sheep in front and bone meal will be applied to the ground. Also shears will shear sheep.
va.guide.entry.dispenser.page2=The dispenser now also can insert and take out music discs from the jukebox in front of it aswell as naming entities in front with nametags.\nAlso the dispenser will place seeds (Provided Quark isn't installed) and use swords to damage entities in front of it. Note that naming the tools "Range: x" will perform the action x blocks away.
va.guide.entry.dispenser.page3=Putting a stick inside a dispenser will allow it to perform a right-click on blocks.\nEnder Pearls can now also be thrown by a dispenser giving it a 5%% chance of spawning Endermites in front of it.

# XP Hopper
va.guide.entry.xphopper.page1=This block is a small upgrade to the normal hopper. It'll collect any xp orbs above it in a 3x3x3 radius and fill them into bottles provided from the bottle slot. A progressbar indicates how much xp is needed until the next bottle is filled. Full bottles will be output like any other item.
va.guide.entry.xphopper.page2=§oScrew those villagers, I can make my own xp bottles!§r

# Redstone Clock
va.guide.entry.redstoneclock.page1=This block really doesn't need a description. It does exactly what you think it does. It emits a redstone pulse in a given delay. The delay can be set by right clicking on it. Also It will only emit signals if it is powered by redstone.\nFor the delay remember that 20 ticks equal 1 second.
va.guide.entry.redstoneclock.page2=§oTime is a tool you can hang on your wall or wear it on your wrist§r\n\nTip: Hold Shift to convert ticks into seconds. Nifty.

# Filtered Hopper
va.guide.entry.filteredhopper.page1=This is another upgrade to the vanilla hopper. It offers you five slots to filter items. You can change between white and blacklist. The hopper also offers these filter modes:\n- Match Meta\n- Match NBT\n- Match Mod id
va.guide.entry.filteredhopper.page2=§oSorry we don't have any unfunny phrases for this one. Is Pepsi okay?§r

# BOP Compat
va.guide.entry.bopcompat.page1=It seems like you have Biomes o' Plenty installed.\nSo the dispenser will be able to use all tools from BoP!

# Tcon Compat
va.guide.entry.tconcompat.page1=Looks like you installed Tinker's Construct.\nTools from this mod can be used in the dispenser now!

# Desription tag
va.guide.entry.descriptiontag.page1=This item let's you give items a custom description. The usage of it is as follows:\nGive this item a name in an anvil and combine it with any other item to apply the name of the tag as a description. Adding a '+' infront of the name will add to the current description of the item. Adding '++' will add the description to the last line. Also naming it "null" will clear the description.
va.guide.entry.descriptiontag.page2=§oNaming things just wasn't enough§r\n\nNote: 7n will insert a new line
