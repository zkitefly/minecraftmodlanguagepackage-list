naturalpledge.entry.divinity_intro=Divine Faith
naturalpledge.tagline.divinity_intro=Kneel before the gods
naturalpledge.page.divinity_intro0=Traces of divine work are evident in this world. &4Mana&0, for one. The stuff of magic isn't possibly made by mortal hand. It is only a question of how to connect with these gods.
naturalpledge.page.divinity_intro1=The &1Holy Symbol&0 is the needed artifact for this connection, with what seems to be a wild storm of unrealized potential. Although crafted of simple materials, it has a ready acceptance of other magic. This is the gate to the &3Divine&0, and can be used to forge direct connections in the form of a &1Priestly Emblem&0. Wearing one will grant you more knowledge in this section.
naturalpledge.page.divinity_intro2=A key to the zodiac
naturalpledge.page.divinity_intro3=The connection the &1Priestly Emblems&0 give you are strong, but don't contain the full power you can harness. An interface to channel the power of a god on earth is required, to allow you to fully command the power you have gained. This interface is the &1Terrestrial Focus&0, a device which can cast &3Divine&0 spells.
naturalpledge.page.divinity_intro4=Taking a level in Cleric
naturalpledge.page.divinity_intro5=Even then, some may not wish to bind themselves to a god, but instead to fight them. By oversaturating the connection between a priest and their follower with &4Mana&0, you can fully cut it off. This can be accomplished by holding a &1Mortalstone&0, which forces &4Mana&0 into the soul of anyone around you.
naturalpledge.page.divinity_intro6=The Kaj's weapon

naturalpledge.entry.njord=Faith in Njord
naturalpledge.tagline.njord=Wind, sea, and sky
naturalpledge.page.njord0=The &4Vanir&0 god of the fluid elements, &3Njord&0, seems like a worthy choice for your faith. Wielding his aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your body hydrophobic, rising above any kind of fluid. You also gain attacks with the force of the wind, barreling your foes back with your every hit.
naturalpledge.page.njord1=At the doom of men he will come back

naturalpledge.entry.njord_spells=Movement Magic
naturalpledge.tagline.njord_spells=The art of changing flows
naturalpledge.page.njord_spells0=The first spell that &3Njord&0's emblem grants, &1Rush of Wind&0, is a simple launching motion. It accelerates the caster in the direction they look, allowing for rudimentary flight. Any device that allows the user to glide seems an interesting combination with this.
naturalpledge.page.njord_spells1=The second spell of &3Njord&0, &1Galeforce&0, is a general protection spell. Most beings and projectiles will be pushed back from the player, giving them a sphere of safety.
naturalpledge.page.njord_spells2=The third spell of &3Njord&0, &1Sudden Gust&0, allows for corralling animals without harming them. The being the player looks at will be forced back when it's cast, as if the player had hit them.
naturalpledge.page.njord_spells3=The final spell of &3Njord&0, &1Tempest Infusion&0, forces the strength of a storm into a shard of the sea, making &1Aquamarine&0. If you can somehow augment your emblem's power, the storm within the shard might be more potent.

naturalpledge.page.idunn0=The &4Vanir&0 god of the living elements, &3Idunn&0, seems like a good choice to declare yourself for. Wielding her aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your body naturally catalytic to the growth of trees, giving saplings around you an effect similar to &1Bonemeal&0.

Giving the &1Focus&0 to someone else in that time will treat them as if they had been the one to cast the spell.
naturalpledge.page.idunn_spells1=The second and final spell of &3Idunn&0, &1Life Catalyst&0, forces power into livingwood, twisting it to become &1Soulroot&0. If you can somehow augment your emblem's power, the root's lifeforce might be more potent.

Wielding his aspect of the &3Divine&0 makes your body makes your body swift, similar to the &1Soujourner's Sash&0.

naturalpledge.tagline.thor_spells=The art of war
naturalpledge.page.thor_spells0=The first spell that &3Thor&0's emblem grants, &1Lightning Strike&0, is a very simple lightning spell. Electricity will arc out of the caster, striking whatever they're looking at within 10 blocks. This won't do much unless you hit a mob, of course.
naturalpledge.page.thor_spells1=The second spell of &3Thor&0, &1Thunder's Force&0, is a strength spell. While you have the &1Terrestrial Focus&0, for half a minute you will hit with over twice the force you'd normally wield. Giving the &1Focus&0 to someone else in that time will treat them as if they had been the one to cast the spell.
naturalpledge.page.thor_spells2=The third spell of &3Thor&0, &1Chains of Iron&0, almost seems to intrude upon the domain of &4Movement magic&0.

naturalpledge.page.heimdall_spells1=The second spell of &3Heimdall&0, &1Wave of Bifrost&0, creates for you a safe haven. When you cast it, a sphere of &4Bifrost&0 will rise around you, stopping your fall and giving you temporary protection from anything around you.

naturalpledge.entry.sleep_stone=Stone of Meditation
naturalpledge.tagline.sleep_stone=Sleep far away from a base
naturalpledge.page.sleep_stone0=When travelling far away from home, it can often be hard to sleep to accelerate the night. If you use a &1Stone of Meditation&0, it allows you to simulate sleep from far away from a base. Hold it and you'll begin to meditate, simulating sleep in a &1Bed&0.
naturalpledge.page.sleep_stone1=Peer into the Spirit

naturalpledge.entry.nether_stone=Stone of Nether Fracture
naturalpledge.tagline.nether_stone=Point to your last portal
naturalpledge.page.nether_stone0=The &1Stone of Nether Fracture&0 acts like a &1Traveller's Waystone&0, except it points directly to the last &4Nether Portal&0 you stepped through. Like the &1Stone of Return&0, shift-clicking in the air will clear its destination.
naturalpledge.page.nether_stone1=Keralian resonance

naturalpledge.entry.poly_stone=Stone of Assimilation
naturalpledge.tagline.poly_stone=Break things your tools won't normally
naturalpledge.page.poly_stone0=If a regular &4Manasteel Tool&0 won't do the job, the &1Stone of Assimilation&0 just might. Anything a regular tool can't break quickly, like &1Glass&0 or &1Leaves&0, the Stone of Assimilation can. It works with the &1Ring of Correction&0. It can also be enchanted just like a regular manasteel tool.
naturalpledge.page.poly_stone1=I am all stones on this blessed day

naturalpledge.tagline.ragnarok=Spin the black circle
naturalpledge.page.ragnarok0=Spin the crackling circle from the waking &1æther&0 of &3Heimdall&0, yellow as the blood of gods. Spin it through the waking &1seas&0 of &3Njord&0, blue as the deepest oceans. Spin it under the waking &1skies&0 of &3Thor&0, green as the grass of plains. Spin it with the waking &1flames&0 of &3Loki&0, red as the blood from which they're born. Spin it to the waking &1land&0 of &3Idunn&0, brown as the deepest dirt, and back to your beginning.
naturalpledge.page.ragnarok1=Offer their souls, and burn forth a token, and may ye see the &3end&0.

naturalpledge.entry.faith_in_ragnarok=Faith in Ragnarok
naturalpledge.tagline.faith_in_ragnarok=The power of the end
naturalpledge.page.faith_in_ragnarok0=The &1twisted pendant&0 seems like a dangerous option for faith. The &3apocalypse&0 is not to be tested lightly. Something about it resonates with the other gods, as if it is tied to their fates. The gifts of every god are conferred through the twisted pendant. As for spells, not all of the spells carried through, leaving you with only one from each god.
naturalpledge.page.faith_in_ragnarok1=There is a single spell unique to faith in &3Ragnarok&0, &4Soul Manifestation&0. While it acts like any other infusion spell, creating &4Iridescence&0, &1Aquamarine&0, &1Thundersteel&0, &1Soulroot&0, and &1Hearth Ember&0, it can also twist the essence of the divine contained within a &1Nether Star&0 into a far purer form: Divine Spirit.
