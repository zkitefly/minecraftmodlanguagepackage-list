Day 4:

This is my first day here in Hell 
Creek, but it has been exciting!
I've discovered what I believe is
Dakotaraptor! I've done my best to
keep my distance, and I don't 
believe it has noticed me. They are
truly beautiful creatures! This
specimen is currently sitting in a
clearing, seeming to observe the 
region.

Day 4 Cont.:

The Dakotaraptor has spotted me!
Rather than attack, it gave some
form of warning before laying back
down. I believe that these animals
don't want to fight unless they
have to. I should leave. It's
beginning to make that call again.

Day 5:

While watching a Thescelosaurus, 
a Dakotaraptor pounced! Truly
magnificent! It held onto the
Thescelosaurus as the others 
ran, using it's claws to kill it 
quickly. Upon it's death, a small
Dakotaraptor approached from 
the bushes and joined the parent 
in eating the kill.
