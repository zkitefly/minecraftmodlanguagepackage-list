	"I discovered that small quartz crystals can be used as both a clock generator as well as for the permanent storage of input information.",
	"In combination with some programming code, silicon, and some energy conductors made from copper, I developed a universal chipset, mainly functioning as a bridge between the processor and the rest of the components.",
	"Furthermore, this logic chipset will always contain the basic code for the processor, allowing the system to boot. For the time being, every system I create will need one of these chipsets.",
	"Assembly:",

	"A logic chipset of high quality (high chip power) has no benefits compared to a normal one!",
		
	"General Information About Chipsets:",
	"Chipsets possess 2 critically important properties. 1) Their performance (§lChip Power§r), which indicates the power of their effect, and the load they draw in a machine (§lCore Power§r), indicating the dedicated performance needed from the machine's processor."
