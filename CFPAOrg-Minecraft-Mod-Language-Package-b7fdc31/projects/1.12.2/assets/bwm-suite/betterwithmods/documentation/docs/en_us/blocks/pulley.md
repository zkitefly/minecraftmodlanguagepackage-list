![Pulley](block:betterwithmods:single_machine@1)

The Pulley can be given [Rope](../items/rope.md) that will automatically descend one block at a time.  
When given mechanical power, if there is any rope already descended it will ascend.  
If given a redstone signal the Pulley will stop all rope movement.  

The rope of a pulley can be attached to a [Platform](platform.md) or [Iron Wall](iron_wall.md) via an [Anchor](anchor.md), allowing it to move all connected platforms as it moves.

Certainly blocks placed on top of connect blocks will also move with the pulley, including Redstone Dust and Minecart Rails.
