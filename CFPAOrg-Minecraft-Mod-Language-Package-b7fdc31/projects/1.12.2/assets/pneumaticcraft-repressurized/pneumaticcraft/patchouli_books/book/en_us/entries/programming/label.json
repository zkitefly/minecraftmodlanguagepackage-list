You must attach a $(l:programming/text)Text/$ widget to this widget to name it. Any jumps/conditions using a $(thing)Text/$ widget of that name will then jump to this label."

A useful tip is to check $(bold)Show Flow/$ checkbox at the bottom left of the $(l:programming/programmer)Programmer/$ GUI;  it will show lines linking $(thing)Jump/Condition/Label/$ widgets of the same name."
