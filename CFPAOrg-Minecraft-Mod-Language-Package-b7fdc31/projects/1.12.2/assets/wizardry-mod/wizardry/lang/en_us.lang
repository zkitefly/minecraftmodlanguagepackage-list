wizardry.book.steps.mana.title=Step 1: Mana
wizardry.book.steps.mana.desc=Learn about what mana is and why you want it so badly
wizardry.book.steps.mana.content0=Of all the energy sources a wizard can draw on, mana is the best. Light blue pools of this watery liquid can be found throughout the world; it also manifests itself in people and objects, giving a trained wizard a constant source of energy to draw on. With it, you can begin to be a threat in the world of wizardry, and begin to work magic.
wizardry.book.steps.mana.content1=A fair warning, the liquid is barely stable. Think of it as a river. A small flow of water is nice to relax in and drift along with, but a raging rapid is not something you want to jump in the way of. Touching it will drain your hunger as it tries to purge your body, while also making you float due to the sheer energy of the liquid. As a result, it's next to impossible to drown in it.
wizardry.book.steps.mana.content2=Now of course, we want to get this liquid into our bodies to use it. To get mana inside of you, craft a syringe and craft that syringe with a mana orb or hold down the syringe pointing at some mana liquid in the world. You now have a mana syringe that you can inject straight into your bloodstream.
wizardry.book.steps.mana.content3=Just like anything else, too much mana is a bad thing.. Drinking too much water can pose a threat to your health. Doing the same with mana is several magnitudes more dangerous. The body can only store a certain amount before it starts to manifest side effects known as "mana burn".<br>Imagine you took all of the world's animal life, gave them all pure caffeine, compressed them into a single squirrel, and then made that squirrel a wizard.<br>That's what having mana burn is like.
wizardry.book.steps.mana.content4=Finally, you can store the mana liquid into orbs. Simply craft glass orbs and throw them a block of liquid mana, it will instantly fill up. You now have portable mana that you will need later. Do stock up on this stuff, you'll need a lot of it.

wizardry.book.steps.garbs.title=Step 2: Garbs
wizardry.book.steps.garbs.desc=Learn about wardrobe you should be using
wizardry.book.steps.garbs.content0=Once you've injected mana, you might be wondering why you don't have a bar showing you how much you have. Well although the mana is flowing in your blood stream right now, you simply cannot channel it yet.<br>Angels are bits of divinity. Their Grace allows them to have a constant supply of mana... but you don't have it that easy. You'll have to make do with what's called a crude halo, instead of the glorious one of an angel.<br> Once you equip the crude halo, you will be able to see your mana bar.
wizardry.book.steps.garbs.content1=Next up is the cape. Capes are not storages, but they are conduits, aiding wizards in mana transference and reducing mana loss. Once you craft yourself a cape, wear it and do not take it off. The cape will get stronger the longer you wear it. At first, it barely reduces spell cost, but after you wear it for prolonged periods of time, it can reduce mana spell cost down to a quarter of what it was.
wizardry.book.steps.garbs.content2=Capes may be glorious and powerful, but they are fickle. They will easily give up their loyalty to another, because one wizard is the same as another to them. If you can cheat a master out of their cape, it's the same as if you'd worn it for years yourself.<br>So if you do happen to find a beautiful, billowing cape on another's rapidly-cooling body, there's no harm in peeling it off and trying it on. And really, does it matter how they died? A cape is a cape.

wizardry.book.steps.nacre.title=Step 3: Nacre
wizardry.book.steps.nacre.desc=Learn about pearls and their magical properties
wizardry.book.steps.nacre.content0=Nacre, the liquid that pearls are formed from - known as mother-of-pearl - is a very thick, pale, and iridescent liquid that is able to channel mana quite flawlessly.<br>To get this liquid, simply throw a gold nugget into liquid mana, and they'll mix together into the resplendent stuff.<br>Now, as for why you want this: with it you can create "nacre pearls", which can be infused with spells to cast them.
wizardry.book.steps.nacre.content1=To make a nacre pearl, take a glass orb and throw it in the milky liquid. There are six levels of nacre pearl quality. Wasted is the worst, then drained, flawed, decent, potent, and finally, Apex. You ideally want Apex Pearls, but that takes careful effort to make. The worse the quality of the pearl, the weaker the spell and the more mana it consumes. To get the highest pearl quality, you must keep the glass orb in the nacre for &oexactly&r 30 seconds. Any more reduces quality, but any less does too. This isn't required, of course. Apex pearls are good, but  you will do fine with potent and decent quality pearls.<br>You will be using these pearls later on in spell infusion.

wizardry.book.steps.structures.title=Step 4: Structures
wizardry.book.steps.structures.desc=Learn about the structure you will need to build
wizardry.book.steps.structures.content0=You've got your mana, you've got your crooked halo, you've got your beautiful cape, and you've got your shimmering nacre pearls. But how do you actually infuse a spell into a pearl? Well, we just need one last device before we get there.
wizardry.book.steps.structures.content1=The first structure is a Mana Battery. This structure is a massive reservoir of mana.<br>As any wizard will quickly learn, this is the center of your powers. The Mana Battery's core can absorb mana far more efficiently than any other method of storage. To fill it, set mana orbs on the pillars in its structure; it will discharge its power to mana orbs outside of the battery's pillars, allowing for automatic and efficient mana transfer out of the battery.
wizardry.book.steps.structures.content2=Do note that once you place the mana battery block down, you will see red dots highlighting where blocks of the structures are going to be. Shift right click the block to display a hologram of the structure itself. Adjust the battery's position as you please. Once you finish the structure, no red dots should be flashing.
wizardry.book.steps.structures.content3=This structure is technically not required. You could manually replace emptied mana orbs in your other structures to feed them mana, but you'll quickly find that that task is very annoying and tedious to do.
wizardry.book.steps.structures.content4=The last structure you will need, and arguably the most important one, is the Crafting Altar. This structure is where you will follow spell recipes, then cap them off with a nacre pearl, to create a pearl capable of casting your spell.<br>How this is done will be recounted in the next entries. For now, build the structure very close by the mana battery structure and fill its pillars with glass orbs or mana orbs to fill the Crafting Plate up with mana.
wizardry.book.steps.structures.content5=Note that the mana battery will be able to fill up the orbs in the Crafting Altar's pillars automatically if the battery has been fed with mana. The orbs inside the Altar's structure will fill up the crafting plate.

wizardry.book.steps.spell_creation.title=Step 5: Spell Creation
wizardry.book.steps.spell_creation.desc=Learn how to create your very first spell finally
wizardry.book.steps.spell_creation.content0=This is the step where you actually make your spells. You're finally ready.<br>To start off, make yourself a Magician's Worktable, and place it down. Once you open it up, you will see several things.<br>It's very important that you carry this codex in your inventory while making a spell. I'll tell you why in a bit.
wizardry.book.steps.spell_creation.content1=To your top left, you will see three sidebars. The top left sidebar is for Shape components. Shape components control how your spell will be cast. IE: If you want it to cast as a beam, as a projectile, upon smacking something, as a zone, etc…
wizardry.book.steps.spell_creation.content2=To the right of the Shapes are the Effect components. These control what your spell actually does. If you want a lightning spell, a time slowing spell, a slippery spell, a gravity well, etc…
wizardry.book.steps.spell_creation.content3=Below the Shapes are the Event components. These filter &oout&r everything else. For example, when you run a projectile spell, it will run on entities and/or blocks regardless. With an event component, you will be able to affect &oonly&r entities, for example.
wizardry.book.steps.spell_creation.content4=To make your first spell, drag a Shape component onto the piece of paper in the center, then drag an effect component to the center. Then hold down right click and drag from the Shape component to the Effect component on your paper, you will see a connecting line. This line's direction matters, and connecting it in reverse won't work. This is because doing it like this tells your spell that it will first run a Projectile Shape, then when that Projectile Shape hits and needs to run its Effect, it will run the Effect you pass into it. The opposite is an Effect shape that doesn't know how to actually start, so it fizzles out.<br>Try this example: Drag a Projectile Shape and a Freeze Effect and right click drag from the Projectile Shape to the Freeze Effect.
wizardry.book.steps.spell_creation.content5=This spell is very weak at it's base. You can upgrade it at the cost of more mana or burnout. For example, if you want to add more range to the projectile, click on the Projectile Shape that you placed on your paper, you will see a list of modifiers you can apply on the right. Click the Range modifier to apply it. Click more to apply more.
wizardry.book.steps.spell_creation.content6=Once you are satisfied with your spell, click the &oSave&r button on the top right. This will save your spell's recipe into &othis&r codex. You will see a new bookmark in this codex with the recipe of the spell you want to create. So be sure you have this codex on your person when you make a spell.
wizardry.book.steps.spell_creation.content7=Now that you saved your spell, check the Spell Recipe bookmark in this book. You will see a list of items that you need to gather and throw into the crafting plate &o&lin order&r. Fill your Mana Battery up with mana, then throw your nacre pearl into the crafting plate. Finally, wait for your spell to craft for a minute. You will be greeted with an explosion of mana around the nacre pearl sitting at the center of the plate. You now have an spell-infused pearl at your disposal. Craft it with an empty staff to mount it to it, then you can use your staff to cast your spell! Congratulations, my friend. You are now a wizard. I fear for the poor animals in the wake of your first pyrokinetics.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.book.title=Spellforger's Codex
wizardry.book.items_blocks.book.content0=The Spellforger’s Codex is the sum of my teachings to you, although it is a paltry shadow of the Akashic Record all Wizardry descends from. Simply throwing a book into mana will infuse it with Wisdom, connecting it to the source of knowledge through the angel blood. This book holds all secrets you shall need for the art of Wizardry, and provides blank pages for you to record your spellcraft. These pages will also tell you the ingredients for your spells. Simply copy your spell into the book from the Magician’s Worktable to have the recipe displayed on the pages.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.devil_dust.title=Devil Dust
wizardry.book.items_blocks.devil_dust.content0=&oDevil dust is a purified form of the conductive Redstone dust, which, instead of conducting electricity, conducts magic.&r<br><br>It is made by throwing Redstone into fire. It will fizzle a bit then plop out the hellish dust.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.fairy_dust.title=Fairy Dust
wizardry.book.items_blocks.fairy_dust.content0=Upon killing a fairy, found in the underworld, it will often leave behind some of its essence, in the form of fairy dust. This potent dust is a key ingredient in many magical reagents, such as sky dust, due to the link it has to the concept the fairy was created from.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.sky_dust.title=Sky Dust
wizardry.book.items_blocks.sky_dust.content0=Devil dust represents adhesion, so naturally, sky dust represents the conceptual opposite: repulsion. Sky dust is created by throwing fairy dust into fire, burning away the magic and leaving only the aimless freedom the fairy represents. By itself, it has negligible effects. However, it is a very potent reagent for arcane purposes.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.wisdom_sapling.title=Wisdom Sapling
wizardry.book.items_blocks.wisdom_sapling.content0=Wisdom is a property of magic. It is the innate potential to use mana, the potential to be more than mundane. While you might lack Wisdom, it just so happens that trees soak mana up rather nicely. In the process, they gain Wisdom, and so a standard sapling can be made into a Wisdom Wood Sapling by soaking it in mana.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.wisdom_wood.title=Wisdom Wood
wizardry.book.items_blocks.wisdom_wood.content0=&oWisdom wood is a form of wood that has evolved to parasitically feed on mana, making it useful for making anything that shapes the liquid power. If we could make apprentice cloaks of treated wisdom wood, then we could keep you from using magic at all, and save us the hassle.&r
wizardry.book.items_blocks.wisdom_wood.content1=Any type of wood can be converted into wisdom wood simply by throwing the wood into liquid mana.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.magicians_worktable.title=Magician's Worktable
wizardry.book.items_blocks.magicians_worktable.content0=While some are able to create spells on the fly, you will need to plan out what you want your spell to do first. The Magician's Worktable provides a convenient space to map out the behavior, and allows you to easily transfer those plans into the Spellforger's Codex. In doing so, the Codex will reveal the items and order needed to create the spell in the Crafting Altar, in a manner even you should be able to understand. For more in-depth information on how the Worktable functions, go review step 5 of "The 5 Steps to Becoming a Wizard"

wizardry.book.items_blocks.crafting_plate.title=Crafting Plate
wizardry.book.items_blocks.crafting_plate.content0=The crafting plate is the core of the crafting altar; it holds the ingredients needed to create your spell and infuses them into the nacre pearl using the mana provided. See step 4 of “The 5 Steps To Becoming A Wizard” for a full explanation on how the structure works.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.mana_battery.title=Mana Battery
wizardry.book.items_blocks.mana_battery.content0=The mana battery is, self-explanatorily, a crystal capable of storing mass amounts of mana. It is created by infusing a diamond with soul sand via devil dust, along with consuming nine source blocks of mana. This combination will form a crystal with the required capabilities, although the input and extraction of mana requires the use of a structure highlighted in part four of “The 5 Steps To Becoming A Wizard.”

wizardry.book.items_blocks.crude_halo.title=Crude Halo
wizardry.book.items_blocks.crude_halo.content0=&oThe crude halo is a bad representation of divinity. While it's nowhere near as potent as the Grace of an angel, it... does the job of holding mana, if not bestowing it.&r
wizardry.book.items_blocks.crude_halo.content1=If you like wearing baubles and trinkets, you can wear it on your head alongside your armor. Otherwise, it'll have to take the place of your helmet. It may not look as fancy as the real deal, but it'll do.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.nacre_pearl.title=Nacre Pearl
wizardry.book.items_blocks.nacre_pearl.content0=Nacre pearls are at the core of a wizard’s arsenal. The structure of these pearls accepts spells readily, and allows you to cast that spell by drawing mana through them. To be able to do so, craft a pearl together with a staff, or press the pearl-swapping key if you have a pearl belt equipped. For more info on Nacre pearls, see the third part of “The 5 Steps To Becoming A Wizard.”

wizardry.book.items_blocks.pearl_belt.title=Pearl Belt
wizardry.book.items_blocks.pearl_belt.content0=As you have diversified your spells, you have no doubt noticed the inconvenience associated with changing between them. Pulling out the old pearl and putting in the new one wastes valuable time, and carrying many staves around leaves you much less room to work with. There exists an item called the Pearl Belt, which allows you to store nacre pearls for quick and fluid swapping in and out of your staff.<br><br>To add pearls to the belt, simply use the belt, and its imbued magic will tell you the rest of the process. It is quite foolproof, so don't worry. Then, use your pearl-swapping key to swap pearls while holding the staff.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.orbs.title=Orbs
wizardry.book.items_blocks.orbs.content0=Glass orbs are used to capture both nacre and mana, giving you from these powerful liquids the iridescent Nacre Pearls and the invaluable Mana Orbs.
wizardry.book.items_blocks.orbs.content1=Mana orbs are made simply by throwing glass orbs into liquid mana.<br>Nacre pearls, on the other hand, require more precision. To get the best quality pearl, you can refer to the third step of becoming a Wizard: Nacre.
wizardry.book.items_blocks.orbs.content2=Wizards who find themselves clumsily stumbling into mana pools on the ground will notice the strange inverse gravity granted to them for a few moments. There is a way to harness this into something useful, however. Putting a small amount of iron into an orb full of mana will filter the liquid, drawing from it the majority of its magical effects, and leaving an Orb of Levitation. The orb will quickly decay, so use it wisely.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.staff.title=Staff
wizardry.book.items_blocks.staff.content0=A nacre pearl is the lens that shapes mana into your spell, but the staff is the conduit that channels the mana through the pearl. Infused with the Wisdom of the wood it’s made out of, the staff allows you to push mana through the pearl, something a Wisdomless being cannot do without assistance from a tool.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.real_halo.title=Real Halo
wizardry.book.items_blocks.real_halo.content0=The crude halo allows a taste of power, but mere gold cannot compare to divinity. While true halos can only be acquired by slaying the current wielder, there is a way to make something very very similar. Throw a Nether Star, a bottle of Dragon's Breath, a shard of Prismarine, some Fairy Dust, some Devil Dust, and a unicorn horn into 25 source blocks of mana, and wait.
wizardry.book.items_blocks.real_halo.content1=The reaction between such powerful reagents will create something that is as close to a real halo as you can get. This halo can hold several times the mana of the Crude Halo and provides passive regen, meaning no more need for mana boosters. Be careful, though, while this halo may be close to a true halo, it is still somewhat physical; its power makes it a prime target for theft by malicious wizards.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.cape.title=Cape
wizardry.book.items_blocks.cape.content0=A wizard is nothing without looking the part. This is true both literally and figuratively, as with an imitation Halo. A cape is one of the most essential elements of the wizard's garb, and simply wearing one will make magic recognize you as a wizard more readily. But it takes time for the cape to adapt to you, and the longer you wear it, the more efficient it gets. It can reduce the mana strain of casting spells by a factor of four, given enough time to bathe in your essence.<br>Although it doesn't have to be your essence. A cape is a cape, no matter whose it was. As you are likely without much skill or practice, it might be in your best interests to find another wizard's cape, one that has been worn for a long time, to steal.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.syringe.title=Syringes
wizardry.book.items_blocks.syringe.content0=There are only so many ways to get access to raw magic, and as a being lacking in natural Wisdom, you cannot do it by yourself. And Mana, while useful, doesn't do much to help when outside of a vessel. So, you need a way to get it - the blood of angels - into *your* bloodstream. Injecting it is the most effective way to do so. You should be able to sense how much unused mana you have in your blood, if you're wearing a halo, by directing your focus to the bottom right corner of your vision.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.super_mana_booster.title=ManaBuilder Serum Premium Plus™
wizardry.book.items_blocks.super_mana_booster.content0=What in the Name gave you the idea to create such a disgusting product? You are mixing things that shouldn’t be mixed! I can’t even imagine why you would want to inject this unholy concoction into your veins...

wizardry.book.items_blocks.vortex_bomb.title=Vortex Bomb
wizardry.book.items_blocks.vortex_bomb.content0=Devil dust may bring adhesion, but its effects are negligible in its raw form. One of the easiest ways to make effects manifest in dust express themselves is to add gunpowder. Just mix the two and wrap them up in something akin to paper, and you will have a vortex bomb, an explosive that will create a brief, but powerful gravity well. Be warned, the range is very large, so it is not advised to use this near anything you wish to continue existing.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.repulsion_bomb.title=Repulsion Bomb
wizardry.book.items_blocks.repulsion_bomb.content0=Naturally, the process used in the vortex bomb applies to sky dust as well. Unlike conventional explosives, which do still push you away, this repulsion bomb does not damage anything directly. The surge of power from the gunpowder is converted into a surge of repulsive force, bringing extra force to the shock wave. The range and power, like the vortex bomb, are quite large, so home use is not recommended.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.fairy_wings.title=Fairy Wings
wizardry.book.items_blocks.fairy_wings.content0=Sometimes, when you break a fairy, it won't fully dissipate, leaving behind an intact pair of wings. Now, before you go thinking you can fly with these things - because that's always the first thing they try - these wings are miniscule, and aren't even capable of truly lifting the fairy, let alone a human. These wings do, however, contain more of the fairy's energy than the dust, and can be used as an ingredient.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.unicorn_horn.title=Unicorn Horn
wizardry.book.items_blocks.unicorn_horn.content0=Unicorns have notable battle prowess, owing this to their sharp horns. While they are often thought of as having magical healing properties, it is much easier to use them to take life than to give it. Unicorn horns are components for both spells and physical weapons, making them highly valuable.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.unicorn_dagger.title=Unicorn Dagger
wizardry.book.items_blocks.unicorn_dagger.content0=A unicorn's horn is a powerful healing tool, but to harness that healing power requires incredible knowledge of magic and medicine. Instead, it is much easier to use that power to harm instead of heal. By binding the severed horn with a quartz coating and a golden hilt, and using devil dust to effect the process, the horn becomes a dagger capable of striking with the arcane potency the unicorn once possessed.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.fairy_imbued_apple.title=Fairy Imbued Apple
wizardry.book.items_blocks.fairy_imbued_apple.content0=It is possible to use alterations of other kinds of magic on our own. The magic which allows Golden Apples is far removed from our arts, but we can apply our own works on that power. By using fairy dust and wings, you can create an apple with the ability to empower you, but instead of the healing gold provides, the apple gives you the freedom and aimlessness of the wispy creatures slaughtered to create it.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.nacre_block.title=Nacre Blocks
wizardry.book.items_blocks.nacre_block.content0=Nacre has decorative uses as well. When fashioned into a solid cube, it looks quite pretty in addition to being structurally stable enough to not collapse in on itself. It is also solid enough to be fashioned into bricks. These blocks are purely decorative however, and serve no special purpose.

wizardry.book.items_blocks.mana_magnet.title=Mana Magnet
wizardry.book.items_blocks.mana_magnet.content0=This block currently has no use, but it may have one in the future.

wizardry.book.mobs.fairies.title=Fairies
wizardry.book.mobs.fairies.desc=Where to find them and how to puree them
wizardry.book.mobs.fairies.content1=The most important attribute of what we call 'fairies' -- and by far the first thing that most young wizards notice -- is that they are extremely annoying. Although they actually appear to be some kind of by-product of mana usage and have nothing resembling sentience, they have a remarkable knack for being in exactly the wrong place at the wrong time. Any time a wizard attempts some great feat of concentration anywhere near fairies, it is almost guaranteed that the little blighters will do their utmost to distract the magical process.
wizardry.book.mobs.fairies.content2=Like unicorns, however, these underworld-native creatures are not entirely useless: if you can catch one and squeeze it into a jar, it provides a magnificent light source. Also, you can use them to make excellent jam.

wizardry.book.mobs.spirit_wights.title=Spirit Wights
wizardry.book.mobs.spirit_wights.desc=Restless roamers with unfinished business
wizardry.book.mobs.spirit_wights.content1=Little is known about these underworld-native creatures. Those few unfortunate enough to have any interaction with them rarely survive the experience; as a result, the few observations that survive are more to do with how quickly they can disassemble the average wizard than with their patterns or behaviours. As a result, the only real advice for dealing with them is this: if you see one, run. And don't stop.
wizardry.book.mobs.spirit_wights.content2=It is possible to fight a spiritwight. It is even theoretically possible to win, in the same way that it is theoretically possible to win a fist fight with a dragon. Strong potions of harming have proven to have some effect on them, in so far as these things can be measured, and it is possible that a wizard of exceptional power and skill may be able to craft weapons and armour strong enough to successfully oppose them. If this is you, do make sure to tell people; they probably won't believe you, but at least someone will know.
wizardry.book.mobs.spirit_wights.content3=If you decline to fight them -- which, let's be honest, is the only sensible choice -- then do not be deceived by their sluggishness. Spiritwights are slow, lumbering things, but this belies their relentless nature. Once a spiritwight has caught the scent of a wizard, they will hunt them almost to the ends of the earth. When you run from them, keep looking over your shoulder. and don't ever stop for long. They certainly won't.
wizardry.book.mobs.spirit_wights.content4=It is one final point of interest that spiritwights reserve their hatred for wizards. As far as we know, they show no interest in any other creature. A unicorn may go where a wizard fears to tread, and face no danger. There must be some reason for this, but who knows it.

wizardry.book.mobs.unicorns.title=Unicorns
wizardry.book.mobs.unicorns.desc=Getting kicked back to Overworld has never been easier
wizardry.book.mobs.unicorns.content1=Please, make no mistake; these are not the gentle, damsel-loving creatures of song and story. The tales I heard as a child about unicorns were keen to stress their beauty and intelligence, their kindness and faithfulness. Real unicorns are better described as 'stroppy'.
wizardry.book.mobs.unicorns.content2=These underworld-native creatures are savage and territorial, sharp of horn and hard of hoof. As far as we can tell, they possess a burning desire to kick, stab or otherwise maim any animal that crosses their path - wizards included - and will even resort to biting if in the mood. They seem to harbor a particular grudge against fairies, which they eat when possible.
wizardry.book.mobs.unicorns.content3=Some have argued that unicorns have little practical value, but their horns have potent magical properties. Also - as I've said elsewhere - fairies are remarkably annoying, so anything that keeps their numbers down can't be all bad.

wizardry.book.dimensions.underworld.title=Underworld
wizardry.book.dimensions.underworld.desc=Learn about the Underworld
wizardry.book.dimensions.underworld.content1=<WIP><br>The domain of Zachriel, Angel of Memory.<br><br>Life is rare among the cloudy skies of the Underworld (it is the realm of the dead, after all), but there are a few beings who call it home.
wizardry.book.dimensions.underworld.content2=To get to the underworld, jump from a height over 130 blocks and smack bedrock, you will fall straight through into the top of the underworld where you will be greeted with a pleasant and relatively safe fall to it’s clouds. Be careful though, some devices that stop fall damage may also stop you from gaining enough momentum to break through, and you might end up splatting against the bedrock instead.
wizardry.book.dimensions.underworld.content3=To get back from the underworld, fall into its void. You will fall straight into the top of the overworld.

wizardry.book.dimensions.torikki.title=Torikki
wizardry.book.dimensions.torikki.desc=Learn about Torikki
wizardry.book.dimensions.torikki.content0=Do not come here, it’s incomplete,<br> ---------- <br>There’s no way to get there unless you cheat.<br> ---------- <br>Don’t let your curiosity lead you down this path,<br> ---------- <br>All that awaits is file corruption and wrath.
