#Page Text
te.research_page.BASICEMC.1=Congratulations on embarking on your new journey, Alchemist! Perhaps you are weary of performing the same grindy tasks over and over every day in your world, or you simply desire more power for... purposes, or you'd simply like the utility and art of magic at your disposal. Whatever it is, alchemy is sure to fit your needs. The art of alchemy has been known since ancient times. It was discovered by a man by the name of x3n0ph0b3, and refined through multiple iterations. After x3n0ph0b3's retirement, a new apprentice, Pahimar, took up the development of the art. Our story grows more complex after this.
te.research_page.BASICEMC.2=The people of the country began speaking out, shaming alchemists for their work, calling them "lazy cheaters", uttering strange words to the kin of "EE2 OP!!!!!!". The art of alchemy itself was deemed too powerful ("OP") by the people. In response to this, Pahimar abandoned his developments and began research anew, preferring investigation of other means of alchemy, while other alchemists were driven into hiding or gave up on alchemy altogether. ... Though many in the world above believe that the true art of alchemy, the knowledge of x3n0ph0b3 himself, has been lost, we gladly beg to differ.
te.research_page.BASICEMC.3=A wanderer, MozeIntel, happened upon a piece of lore from the distant past and attempted to reproduce it in its entirety. Eventually, for reasons unknown (reasons he strangely described as "IRL"), Moze had to retire. Another apprentice, SinkillerJ, eager to lead the investigation, stepped up and forged onward. Following clues, he eventually happened upon the abode of old x3n0ph0b3! With his blessing, he set to work rewriting, setting into new stone, the knowledge of ages past. Now we step into the light. The eyes of the world are upon us once more. How will the alchemists be accepted this time?
te.research_page.BASICEMC.4=With our hardest work, our team: SinkillerJ, Blubberblub, Williewillus and Lilylicious do impart upon you, fellow crafter, our most extensive knowledge of the alchemical arts and the magical powers associated with their use. We welcome you, Apprentice, to the world of ProjectE. - williewillus, Honored Master of Lore
te.research_page.PHILOSTONE.1=By infusing a diamond with both the luminous glowstone and the energetic redstone, you have discovered the ancient knowledge of the Philosopher's Stone. With it, you can perform transmutations in the world, changing a block into another through the magic of alchemy.<BR>You can also use it to craft items.
te.research_page.INTERDICTION.1=The interdiction torch will repel monsters that surround it. 
te.research_page.TRANSTABLE.1=With the transmutation table, you can now exchange items for EMC, as well as create other items from EMC.
te.research_page.TRANSMUTATIONTABLET.1=The transmutation tablet is exactly the same as the transmutation table, except that it is condensed into a portable form.
te.research_page.FUELS.1=Using the crucible, you can cram more energy into fuel to create stronger fuel.
te.research_page.EXPLOSIVES.1=Using the stronger fuels that you have already created, you can enhance the explosive power of TNT.
te.research_page.LENSES.1=Using the explosives, you can create foci that lets you direct the destructive power.
te.research_page.DARKMATTER.1=Infusing a block of Aeternalis Fuel with Void Metal and Balanced Shards, you have created an incredibly dense material that is so black it almost seems to absorb the light around it. 
te.research_page.REDMATTER.1=By infusing a Dark Matter Block with even more Aeternalis Fuel, the material has become even denser. Red Matter is the ultimate material.
te.research_page.DMPEDESTAL.1=The Dark Matter Pedestal allows you to use certain items without needing to be present yourself.
te.research_page.DMFURNACE.1=Casually breaking the laws of thermodynamics to create a convenient furnace, sounds like a normal tuesday. Ores have a chance to double their output, while dusts do not. Not only faster than a normal furnace, it is also more fuel efficient and will attempt to automatically move items to nearby chests.
