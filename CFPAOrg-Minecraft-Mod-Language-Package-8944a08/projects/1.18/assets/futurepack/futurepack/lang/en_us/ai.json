	"While analyzing the latest generation of my machines, I noticed that they oftentimes don't use the most efficient crafting methods. This can result in materials being wasted or lost.",
	"Through minor adaptations of their programming, I made it so they can analyze and document their own efficiency. The data created in this way are named \"Support\" points and are stored inside the machine.",
	"I can evaluate the data sets gathered from these \"intelligently\" working machines in my own later research or use the data to create even more intelligent machinery.",
	"Also, when supplied with Support, I can use the Assembly Table to build considerably better components.",
	"Info: The Support Gauge is a yellow meter, usually found on the right-hand side of a machine's GUI. Information regarding the transport and storage of said points can be found on the \"Logistics\" page.",
	"Note: New researchables available in \"Logistics\"!",
