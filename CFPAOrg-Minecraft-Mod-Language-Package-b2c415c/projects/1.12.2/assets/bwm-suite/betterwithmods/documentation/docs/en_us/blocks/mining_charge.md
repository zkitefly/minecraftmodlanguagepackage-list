![Mining Charge](block:betterwithmods:mining_charge)

The Mining Charge is a precision explosive device. It will create a 3x3x2 hole, with a center block for the next charge, facing the direction the charge was placed. Blocks exploded by a charge will always drop items. It can be activated by a Flint and Steel or by a Redstone Signal.
