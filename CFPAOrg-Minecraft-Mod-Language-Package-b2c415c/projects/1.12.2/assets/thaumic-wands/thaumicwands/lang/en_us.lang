# -- Stages --

# Unlock Thaumaturgy
research.UNLOCKTHAUMATURGY.title=Discovering Thaumaturgy
research.UNLOCKTHAUMATURGY.stage.0=While creating a Thaumometer using the Arcane Workbench was relatively easy, it seems like crafting other devices requires, besides raw essentia crystals, vis aswell. However all my efforts to drain it from the aura directly were fruitless, maybe I need some kind of channeling device.
research.UNLOCKTHAUMATURGY.stage.1=Even though I can not rely on using vis for creating my channeling device, I came up with quite elegant, to cast smaller quantities of vis. This rather crude wand is capable of storing 50 vis inside of it, now I just need to fill it with some vis.

# Base Thaumaturgy
research.BASETHAUMATURGY.title=Basic Thaumaturgy
research.BASETHAUMATURGY.stage.0=Now that I have my Wand I can begin assembling arcane devices, but I doubt that this Wand will be enough maybe I should begin looking at other Materials.
research.BASETHAUMATURGY.addendum.0=I realized that those foci I made do not only fit a top of the Casters Gaunlet, but also dircetly at the tip of my wand. Interstingly the foci started to drain the vis and not from the surrounding aura but from my wand, this might be come in handy.

# Primal Charm
research.PRIMALCHARM.title=Primal Charm
research.PRIMALCHARM.stage.0=While I was unable to charge my wand from the aura around me, I found small orbs of vis allowing me to charge it nonetheless, however it should be possible to construct a device that is able to drain atleast a little of the surrounding aura to charge my wand.
research.PRIMALCHARM.stage.1=I came up with a small device that is basically an augmented vis resonator, creating a vis-feedback-loop from the oscillations of included vis crystals, turning aura into concentrated vis orbs, to be collected using a wand.  

# Copper Caps
research.CAP_COPPER.title=Copper Wand Caps
research.CAP_COPPER.stage.0=Those Engineers use this metal to build their silly machines and conduct something they call flux (these fools have no idea what they are talking about), hopefully it is able to conduct vis aswell.
research.CAP_COPPER.stage.1=If the Engineers knew what they've got at hand there...<BR> This metal, though not better at channeling vis that iron, has a even more interesting property regarding vis crystals. It seems that the vis emitted from this metall is somehow tinted with §7ORDO§r and §8PERDITIO§r, resulting in a decreased amount of vis crystals of these types. 

# Brass Caps
research.CAP_BRASS.title=Brass Wand Caps
research.CAP_BRASS.stage.0=This new metal I created seems to conduct vis better than regular iron, so what if I capped of my wand with some alchemical brass.
research.CAP_BRASS.stage.1=My newly made brass wand caps conduct vis far better than mundane iron does, resulting in a vis discount of 5% 

# Silver Caps
research.CAP_SILVER.title=Silver Wand Caps
research.CAP_SILVER.stage.0=Silver is a metal that is mostly used by Engineers, but it there are also some people that specialize in witchcraft who use it to protect themselves of werewolfs, so maybe there is more to it.
research.CAP_SILVER.stage.1=The witches were right, silver is an incredible vis conductor, but I doubt that they know how to make it show it's full potential, it took me an arcane infusion to make the silver work as a decent vis conductor, but it was worth it. In regards to vis discount it is not really better than brass, but it has a crystal discount on all of 4 elemental aspects, which is great.

# Thaumium Caps
research.CAP_THAUMIUM.title=Thaumium Wand Caps
research.CAP_THAUMIUM.stage.0=How could I not think of this, thaumium is a incredibly magical metal, so making caps out of it is only logical, but I have a feeling that this will prove as a harder task than all the others.
research.CAP_THAUMIUM.stage.1=I was able to constrcut quite nice wand caps out of thaumium. The base design was the same as always, but they did not work as well as I hoped, but after I infused these caps with some essentia and salis mundus, the caps had a much larger affinity for vis, making them better than brass. These caps give a 10 % on all crafts, which is quite decent.

# Void Caps
research.CAP_VOID.title=Void Wand Caps
research.CAP_VOID.stage.0=I've seen things. This metal, it is strong, it is powerful, it is resisting any vis that flows through it, but there must be a way, there MUST...
research.CAP_VOID.stage.1=It works, it actually works. By infusing these caps with dark types of essentia I was able to create caps than conduct vis like nothing I've ever seen before, resulting in a discount of 20 %, but at what cost ?

# Greatwood Rod
research.ROD_GREATWOOD.title=Greatwood Wand Rod
research.ROD_GREATWOOD.stage.0=On my journeys I came across a tree that is somehow different, my Wand is already made of wood, but this wood feels more magical, I probably should try to craft a new wand rod out of it.
research.ROD_GREATWOOD.stage.1=Greatwood is actually great, it took a little vis and some §8Perditio§r Crystals, but I was able to turn it into a new wand rod, that is a lot better than plain wood. It allowes one to store 200 vis, which allows whole new posiibilities, but I have seen some other trees lately.

# Reed Rod
research.ROD_REED.title=Reed Wand Rod
research.ROD_REED.stage.0=I had an idea, what about sugarcane, it react naturally to §e aer§r, so it probably has some effects on my wand. It will take a little effort, but I have high hopes for this one. 
research.ROD_REED.stage.1=This is interresting, the infusion caused the sugarcane to hold 600 vis, which is more than greatwood, intrestingly I feel some weird resonace if I hold it high enough, I wonder what happens if it gets high enough.

# Blaze Rod
research.ROD_BLAZE.title=Blaze Wand Rod
research.ROD_BLAZE.stage.0=I had an idea, what about blaze rod, it react naturally to §6ignis§r and it has a fitting shape, so it probably has some effects on my wand. It will take a little effort, but I have high hopes for this one. 
research.ROD_BLAZE.stage.1=This is interresting, the infusion caused the blaze rod to hold 600 vis, which is more than greatwood, intrestingly I feel some weird resonace near to my furnace, I wonder what happens if it gets hot enough.

# Ice Rod
research.ROD_ICE.title=Ice Wand Rod
research.ROD_ICE.stage.0=I had an idea, what about ice, it react naturally to §9aqua§r, so it probably has some effects on my wand. It will take a little effort, but I have high hopes for this one. 
research.ROD_ICE.stage.1=This is interresting, the infusion caused the ice to hold 600 vis, which is more than greatwood, intrestingly I feel some weird resonace near to snow, I wonder what happens if it gets cold enough.

# Obsidian Rod
research.ROD_OBSIDIAN.title=Obsidian Wand Rod
research.ROD_OBSIDIAN.stage.0=I had an idea, what about obsidian, it react naturally to §2terra§r, so it probably has some effects on my wand. It will take a little effort, but I have high hopes for this one. 
research.ROD_OBSIDIAN.stage.1=This is interresting, the infusion caused the obsidain to hold 600 vis, which is more than greatwood, intrestingly I feel some weird resonace near the ground, I wonder what happens if it get low enough.

# Quartz Rod
research.ROD_QUARTZ.title=Quartz Wand Rod
research.ROD_QUARTZ.stage.0=I had an idea, what about quartz, it react naturally to §fordo§r, so it probably has some effects on my wand. It will take a little effort, but I have high hopes for this one. 
research.ROD_QUARTZ.stage.1=This is interresting, the infusion caused the quartz to hold 600 vis, which is more than greatwood.

# Bone Rod
research.ROD_BONE.title=Bone Wand Rod
research.ROD_BONE.stage.0=I had an idea, what about bone, it react naturally to §8perditio§r, so it probably has some effects on my wand. It will take a little effort, how could I think this is a good idea.
research.ROD_BONE.stage.1=This is interresting, the infusion caused the bone to hold 600 vis, which is more than greatwood.

#Silverwood Rod
research.ROD_SILVERWOOD.title=Silverwood Wand Rod
research.ROD_SILVERWOOD.stage.0=The Wood of this tree seems to hold a much higher magical potential than all other plants I have seen so far, perfect for a sizable wand core, my ambition is high, and so will be the effort I will put into it.
research.ROD_SILVERWOOD.stage.1=I've done it, even though this wood had a lot of potential I was able to increase the amount of storable vis even further, it took quite a bit of essentia, but I am sure that 800 vis should be enough for now.

#Mithrillium Caps
research.CAP_MITHRILLIUM.title=Mithrillium Wand Caps
research.CAP_MITHRILLIUM.stage.0=I never expected there to be a metal even more potent than void metal, but this is truely baffeling, maybe my thaumaturgy studies have ended to soon, maybe I should try forging myself a new pair of wand caps...
research.CAP_MITHRILLIUM.stage.1=It took a lot of salis mundus to get these to work again, but the result was definitly worth it, these caps provide a 25% discount and even a 1 crystal discount on every aspect, but why does it always take so much salis mundus though ?

#Adaminite Caps
research.CAP_ADAMINITE.title=Adaminite Wand Caps
research.CAP_ADAMINITE.stage.0=When Mithrillium is already great, then what about Adaminite it should be even better, it is only logical, but I have a feeling that not only the Warp will affect my sanity this time.
research.CAP_ADAMINITE.stage.1=It turns out I was right, these caps truely are marvelous, they provide a 30% disount and even a doubled primal discount, maybe I should stop now, or maybe I should go even further.

#Adamintewood Rod
research.ROD_ADAMINITEWOOD.title=Adamintewood Wand Rod
research.ROD_ADAMINITEWOOD.stage.0=I've got a problem, it looks like I can not proceed any further unless I find myself an alternative to this silverwood rod, I was a fool thinking 800 vis is enough, I should have started sooner to create a bigger vis storage, but now seems like a good time to start.
research.ROD_ADAMINITEWOOD.stage.1=By infusing a mundane silverwood rod with a lot of adaminite, I was able to make a vessel strong enough to quadruple the vis capacity of the silverwood rod, I know I could have gone further, but I feel uncomfortable dirctly touching such a huge amount of vis with my bare hands, especialy when such a big part of it conducts vis like nothing else in the universe.

#Mithminite Caps
research.CAP_MITHMINITE.title=Mithminite Wand Caps
research.CAP_MITHMINITE.stage.0=This has to be it, this metal, so full of primal energy, so strong of a vis conductor I can't even measure it, I don't care how but I want this for my wand caps, I never desired something more than this.
research.CAP_MITHMINITE.stage.1=Who was I to think that this metal could simply be reactivated by some of this foolish salis mundus, it took some of the purest primal energy I could find, but it was worth it, a 40% vis discount, and a three crystal discount on all of the aspects, I doubt I could go further with this, this is the end.

# - Thaumic Bases -

#Thauminite Caps
research.CAP_THAUMINITE.title=Thauminite Wand Caps
research.CAP_THAUMINITE.stage.0=This metal seems to be quite similar to thaumium, but it is so crystalline and ordered, this should take next to none effort to turn it into a pair of working wand caps.
research.CAP_THAUMINITE.stage.1=Well, that was easier than I expected, it didn't even took an infusion, just some plain salis mundus, while forging the caps, well good for me. A 15% discount and one §7ORDO§r crystal less, that is quite an amazing deal.

# - Planar Artifice -

#Alkimium Caps
research.CAP_ALKIMIUM.title=Alkimium Wand Caps
research.CAP_ALKIMIUM.stage.0=Ever since I discovered this Alkimium I replaced a lot of brass with it, so maybe it is on time that replace my brass caps with it aswell.
research.CAP_ALKIMIUM.stage.1=I was not exacly hopeful, when I thought of this, since alkimium is just a brass derivative, but I did not exspect it to resonate it with so many aspects. <br> While a 5% reduction seems like not that much, alkimium offers a single crystal discount for §3AQUA§r,§2TERRA§r and §7ORDO§r, which is quite something.  

#Bismuth Caps
research.CAP_BISMUTH.title=Bismuth Wand Caps
research.CAP_BISMUTH.stage.0=Bismuth shows a huge reactivity to aura, so turning it into a new pair of Wand Caps probably is not te worst idea, what is Thaumaturgy but a specialized from of Auromancy.
research.CAP_BISMUTH.stage.1=As I exspected Bismuth is a marvelous conductor of vis, granting a 15% discount on all crafts performed with it, even though it is very colorful it does not react to any elemtals what so ever, but to §7ORDO§r and §8PERDITIO§r, which is probably a connection to the ordered vis and the entropic flux. I could have exspected that.
