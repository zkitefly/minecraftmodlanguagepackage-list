![Millstone](block:betterwithmods:single_machine)

The Millstone can receive Mechanical Power from a [Hand Crank](hand_crank.md), or by an [Axle](wooden_axle.md) from the top or bottom.
When powered, the gear inside turns and crushes materials into a finer form. The Items are ground up one at a time, then ejected horizontally into the world.
 
Millstones with have a **Blocked** notification, this is because to properly rotate it needs space all around it so no full blocks can be next to it!
