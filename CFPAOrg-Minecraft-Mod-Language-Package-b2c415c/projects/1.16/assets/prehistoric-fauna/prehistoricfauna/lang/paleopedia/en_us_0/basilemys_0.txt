Day 8:

I discovered a turtle on my 
journey! I believe the turtle
is Basilemys, a somewhat uncommon
sight here. They're truly a sight
to behold. Their hard shells seem
to be used as protection against
the Dakotaraptor, who I have seen
eating overturned Basilemys 
before.

Day 9:

Having followed the Basilemys
throughout yesterday, I've
discovered something truly
fascinating! They love the
horsetails that commonly grow
through out Hell Creek.
