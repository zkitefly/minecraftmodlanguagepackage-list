Day 5

It wasn't long after I had
arrived in Hell Creek that
I noticed these nimble
creatures hiding in the
brush. I heard them before
I saw them, rustling among
the ferns. They always kept
at a distance but after some
time here I managed to get a
closer look. Upon inspection
it turned out to be the
marvelous Thescelosaurus!

These skittish dinosaurs are
fast. Equipped with powerful
hindlimbs they can run away
from other animals of the area,
such as the Dakotaraptor.

Their favorite snack seems to be
the horsetails found here in
Hell Creek. More research will
have to be done.
