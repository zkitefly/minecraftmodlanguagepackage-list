Zamites
These cycadeoids are somewhat 
common throughout the Morrison. 
Ranging from 3 meters tall to 
nearly 7, they are truly a sight to 
behold. I've also discovered that 
the Stegosaurus eats the Zamites 
cones. Could this be how this odd 
scrub reproduces?

Ptilophyllum
These branchy trees can be seen 
throughout the Morrison. Each 
branch seems to end with a bush of 
fronds on it, which I've seen the 
Camarasaurus eating from. Like 
the Zamites they are a cycadeoid, 
a group of plants extremely 
common at this time but extinct in 
the modern world. The Ptilophyllum 
show me how much wonder has 
been lost to prehistory.

Osmundacaulis
An older relative of the Osmunda 
of Hell Creek, these tree ferns 
are quite common here in the 
Morrison. I haven't noticed 
anything taking much interest in 
them.

Horsetails
Like in Hell Creek, horsetails can 
be found here, although in much 
fewer numbers. I've taken note of 
Eilenodon eating the few 
horsetails I've found in the area.
