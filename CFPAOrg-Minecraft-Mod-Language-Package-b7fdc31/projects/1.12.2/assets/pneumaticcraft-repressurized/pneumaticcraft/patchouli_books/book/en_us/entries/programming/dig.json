E.g. if set to 1, the $(item)Drone/$ will only dig one block (regardless of how many blocks are in the area), before moving to the next widget in the program. This can be used to only dig a few blocks and then check the durability of a tool, to repair it before it breaks."

The exception would be blocks that $(italic)never/$ drop an item (even with Silk Touch), for which there is specific $(thing)Match by block/$ option in the filter setup GUI."
