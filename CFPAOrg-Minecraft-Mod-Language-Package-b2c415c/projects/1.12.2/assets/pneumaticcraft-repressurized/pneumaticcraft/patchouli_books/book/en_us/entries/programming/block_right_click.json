This could be used to hoe the ground, place seeds, apply bonemeal, throw a potion, deploy a drone, rotate blocks with a wrench... the possibilities are endless. You can filter which blocks should be $(thing)right-clicked/$ by adding an $(l:programming/item_filter)Item Filter/$ widget which specifies the block."

There are some situations, though (e.g. trying to plant $(item)Seeds/$) where the $(thing)Right Click Block/$ widget is required."
