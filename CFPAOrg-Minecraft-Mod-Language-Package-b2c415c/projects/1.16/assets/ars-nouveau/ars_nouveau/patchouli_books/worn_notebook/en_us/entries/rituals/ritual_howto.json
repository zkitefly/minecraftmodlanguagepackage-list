The brazier will ignite, and is awaiting activation. In this state, you may throw in any additional items as a way to augment the ritual. If you wish to augment a ritual, simply toss the item on top of the brazier."

      "text": "To activate your ritual, interact with the brazier with an empty hand. Once activated, your ritual can no longer be augmented and has been consumed permanently. If a ritual requires source to operate, the brazier will pull from source jars within 6 blocks. Information related to rituals and their requirements can be found in their respective entries."
