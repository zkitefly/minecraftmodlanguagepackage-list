![Soul Urn](block:betterwithmods:urn@8)

The Soul Urn is a block created using the [Filtered Hopper](hopper.md). Its purpose is to make [Soul Forged Steel](../items/soulforged_steel.md) or the creation of powerful devices, such as the [Block Dispenser](block_dispenser.md). To make a Soul Urn, place an empty urn right under a Filtered Hopper and place a Block of Soul Sand into the __filter slot__ of the Filtered Hopper. Once you have done that take 8 [Ground Netherrack](../items/ground_netherrack.md) and *throw* it on to the Filtered Hopper. The Soul Sand will filter the tormented souls from the Netherrack, converting it to [Hellfire](../items/hellfire_dust.md) and safely store up to 8 souls in the internal buffer of a Hopper that is receiving Mechanical Power (from any side other than top or bottom). Once the hopper containers 8 soul it will force the souls from the soul sand to move down into the urn, thus creating a Soul Urn.
