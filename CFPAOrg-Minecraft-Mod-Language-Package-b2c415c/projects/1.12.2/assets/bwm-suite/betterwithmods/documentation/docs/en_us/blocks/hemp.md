Hemp is a strong fibrous plant that can be used for many different things, including strong [Rope](../items/rope.md) or [Fabric](../items/fabric.md)

Hemp seeds, with HCSeeds enabled, can only be obtained from tilling the ground with a hoe; without HCSeeds they drop from tall grass.

These seeds must be planted on hydrated farmland and have plenty of light, be that sunlight or from a [Light Block](light.md).
Growth can also be accelerated by [fertilizing](fertile_farmland.md) the farmland.


Hemp has two stages, it is best to let the plant grow to stage 2 and only harvest the top block, similar to Sugar Cane.
