This tree is extinct in the wild, however certain Alchemists are known to cultivate this tree in private, and may give out saplings to those they trust. Slashing a mature log with a Boline taps it, allowing its blood-red resin to leak out. Brooms made from this rare tree are faster than all but Elder brooms,"
