## -- Descriptions
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.moltenSword=Foes struck by this sword are lit on fire and are inflicted with a weakness and nausea debuff for 5 seconds.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.demonSword=Foes struck by this sword are dealt the same effects as the Arch-Angelic sword though the durations are now 20 seconds each.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.chainSword=Foes struck with this sword are inflicted with a 5 second slowness effect.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.archSword=Foes struck by this sword are dealt with nausea, blindness, poison, wither, weakness and are lit on fire. These effects last for about 10 seconds.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.angelicSword=This unique sword does lower damage than the rest of the voidic sword but in turn it'll one-shot most of the voidic mobs.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicInfusion.pg1=While in the void, without a Voidic Suppressor in hand or the effects of Voidic Immunity, you will slowly gain Voidic Infusion. While under the effects of Voidic Infusion your vision becomes slightly obscured. Your maximum health will decrease. Void Crystal like spikes will begin to form and stick out of your arms and back. At a certian point you will gain the ability to fly. Your attacks will deal an additional 1 Voidic damage.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicInfusion.pg2=This type of damage goes through all forms of protection. You become incorporeal in which certian physical attacks have a chance of passing right through you, dealing no damage. If the amount of Voidic Infusion becomes too great, death will occur. As Voidic Infusion decays, all of these effects begin to wear off and your health returns back to normal.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicDrill=One of the few items that requires Voidic Power to function. Charge this device using a Voidic Charger. If this device contains power and it is being used via holding down right click, it will emit a beacon like laser that mines in a 3x3 area and has a range of up to 10 blocks. This laser will also deal damage to entites.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.realityTeleporter.pg1=The Reality Teleporter is a device which when powered with Voidic Power and contains at least one Hole in Reality, it will teleport the user up to a maximum distance of 64 blocks away. If the user is looking at a block they will be sent in front of that block instead. The 64 range limit is still true for looking at blocks. More information on how this device can be used to link Reality Teleportation Blocks can be found in that entry under Machines.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.realityTeleporter.pg2=Like all Voidic Powered items, this can be charged using a Voidic Charger. To access the GUI you can Shift Right click at any time, if the device lacks enough resources the GUI will open on its own upon right clicking. This uses 200 power and 1 Hole in Reality per use.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.theVoid.pg1=The terrain is similar to that of the Nether's. You'll mostly find Soft Bedrock here. There are large areas of rifts in space known as Holes in Reality. Touching such a hole of reality will send you to a random dimension around the same coordinates from which you were in the Void, give or take ~200 blocks. Any Item that touches such a hole will be lost forever so be careful. Void Crystal Ore and Liquid Void populate the Void as well. You may also find some
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.theVoid.pg2=plant life growing near a source of Liquid Void. Only two entities can be found anywhere within the Void, these are the Void Wraiths and Chained Spectres. On occasion you can find a structure known as a Void Fortress. These Void Fortresses resemble the Nether Fortress in design. Void Wraths and Herobrine's Creepers populate these Fortresses.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.theVoid.pg3=If one were to instead dig straight up in the Void, or enter the Void from some other dangerous method, they may come across a structure known as a Void City, which closely resembles End Cities. It should be noted while in this upper flat layer of the Void, one will take Void damage much like being too deep down in another Dimension.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.theVoid.pg4=A Potion of Plenum is very necessary. These Void Cities can contain chests of Astral Essence and Void Cloth. As well as powerful Ethereal Guardians.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.theVoid.pg5=One final thing to note is that while in the Void without proper items and/or effects, you will take Voidic Infusion which both slowly kills and buffs you.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidWraith=A common entity found within the Void. Its attacks are melee based. Upon death it'll drop Ectoplasm.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.chainedSpectre=A common entity found within the Void. Its attacks are ranged based. Upon death it'll drop Void Chains. If something is slain by a Chained Spectre, another one will rise in place of the dead enemy.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidWrath=Only found within a Void Fortress. These entities are very sturdy and deal quite a bit of damage. They are melee based. They drop Charred bones upon death.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.etherealGuardian=Only found within a Void City. These powerful beings resemble an Efreeti. They weild a Star Forged Sword with the effects of First, Second, and Third Degree Burns. On death they will drop Voidic Phlogistons.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.lich=Only found within a Swampland and quite rare. Liches will do a variety of attacks. These attacks are very deadly so be prepared. Liches do not like one another and will attack each other on sight. Upon death they'll drop Void Cloth.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.herobrineCreeper=Only found within a Void Fortress. These are enhanced Creepers with different visuals. The explosion radius and damage are a bit larger. Though they do not harm the world.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.fruit.pg1=Ethereal Fruits are harvested from Ethereal Plants. These plants can be found naturally in the void next to a source of Liquid Void. Harvesting via Right Click may yield seeds between 1 and 3 as well as fruit between 0 and 3. Yes, there is a chance to not gain any fruit at all. To plant these seeds you'll need to use a Void or Spectre Hoe on Soft Bedrock and have a nearby source of liquid void as normal water will not work.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.fruit.pg2=Before you actually plant the seeds you can alter the soil, this cannot be done if the seeds have already been planted. To alter the soil simply right click it with one of the following: Redstone dust, Lapis dust, Gold dust, Emerald dust, or Diamond dust. Eating these fruits will yield various benefits based on the alterations. A normal fruit grants Voidic Immunity which will prevent and decay any Voidic Infusion on the player.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.fruit.pg3=A redstone fruit gives a buff to strength. Gold gives Absorb and Resistance. Lapis provides a speed buff. Emerald gives a jump buff. And diamond gives a health boost buff. The plants will only grow in light levels 2 and below. This means the plants need darkness.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.fruit.pg4=One can make a Voidic Alchemy Table and combine all the types of Ethereal Fruit into a potion. What this potion does is it gives the user immunity to void damage allowing one to venture down into the void below bedrock in the Overworld.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidCrystalBlock.pg1=This block is the product of bringing together nine Void Crystals. These blocks cannot do much on their own, but holding them gives the same sensation felt when close to the bottom layer of bedrock in the Overworld. Could bringing these blocks close to the void have an effect?
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidCrystalBlock.pg2=This block is used to construct a portal to the Void. Create a formation in the same way as you would to construct a nether portal frame. After doing so, collect an Obsidian Flask and toss it onto the top face of the bottom layer frame. If done correctly a portal will be open, leading to the Void.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidCrystalOre=An ore found only in The End and Void. Its look depends on the dimension as well. If the ore is found in the Void, it will have a Soft Bedrock look. If it is found elsewhere, it will have an End Stone look. This ore will always drop one to three Void Crystals regardless of one's fortune.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.blockFakeBedrock.pg1=Upon entering the Void, you notice that the vast majority of your surroundings is comprised of Bedrock. But unlike the flat, rigid, and unyielding layer found in the overworld, this "Soft" Bedrock makes a clearly defined landscape and feels plush beneath your feet. It has the firmness of stone, so it could be used as a solid building block. Yet it also has the consistency of fertile soil and can be tilled with a strong enough tool.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.blockFakeBedrock.pg2=Which presents the question could something actually grow in this dimension? Time to find out...
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.blockVoidbrick.pg1=These bricks are made from cut Void Crystal Blocks. They appear to be much more sturdy than any other block found in this dimension, but the crystal that makes them up seems to have lost their conductivity for Voidic Power as a result of being cut. While their function as a material for building Void Portals has been lost, that doesn't mean that they're useless. Standing on one of these bricks will actually stall
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.blockVoidbrick.pg2=Voidic Infusion from being gained as if the bricks are trying to consume it from you at the same rate you gain it. Their firm frame could be used for making other objects, or simply for building and decoration.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.realityHole=This Rift in Space can link to many dimensions. Stepping into one will result in being teleported to one of these dimensions, at random, around the same coordinates from where you were in the void, give or take ~200 blocks. Being around these rifts reminds you of the sensation you feel when you're being watched by... him...
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.ritualBlock=This block is used to invoke rituals to empower the Void Vade Mecum
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.cosmicMaterial=A very rare material that can be found in The End and The Void. It is used in Star Forged crafting.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidInfuser.pg1=The special properties of Liquid Void are quite interesting indeed. While one can ponder what exactly makes it behave the way it does, this entry will focus more on harnessing its power. By combining Void Bricks, Void Cloth, a Cauldron, and a Void Star, one can create a machine that can change the physical properties of certain items in much the same way that you change via prolonged exposure to the Void's environment.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidInfuser.pg2=The Infusion Altar can also repair any damaged Void Crystal Tools, Weapons, Armors, and Shields.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidMacerator=This Machine is the product of infusing a standard Furnace with Liquid Void. It takes Voidic Power to grind an input ore into four Void Infused dusts. You can process these dusts into a regular ingot using mundane machines.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.blastfurnace=A type of furnace that requires both Voidic Power and an active Void Flame to be lit under the block. This device can be used to create Voidic Steel using Void Infused Iron Dust and Void Infused Coal Dust.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.Heimdall.pg1=Beacons have the curious effect of seemingly generating a powerful beam of concentrated light. Though, such power cannot possibly be generated on its own. The more logical explanation is that it creates a small gate or rift to the Nether from which it can retrieve this energy. By modifying a Beacon via Void Infusion Altar, one can attune this gate to gather energy from the Void instead. Though, unlike a Beacon, which works effectively in
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.Heimdall.pg2=most places with an open ceiling, the Heimdall requires fuel to keep its gate open. Since it is a modified rift to the nether recalibrated to go to the Void, it requires energy from both realms to function properly. Void Infused Quartz Dust will do the job quite nicely. Heimdall will generate Liquid Void and output the fluid to machines directly under it.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicGen.pg1=They say there is no such thing as nothingness, for even empty space is filled with energy. But given the vacuous nature of The Void, there are plenty of opportunities to exploit this fundamental part of quantum physics. This energy manifests itself as pools of Liquid Void, whose strange physical properties make it behave in even stranger ways. This leaves one to wonder how it can be used; one potential answer can be found in the Voidic
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicGen.pg2=Generator. This machine, which is constructed by surrounding a Void Infusion Altar with Redstone, converts the chemical energy found in Liquid Void back into the unique power from which it is comprised. This "Voidic Power" has many applications, though, details on those details are best saved for another entry.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicCable.pg1=The Voidic Generator is certainly able to supply power, however, it may not be able to reach all the machines you would like it to. However, by combining Redstone, which naturally transmits power, with a Void Crystal Block, which in and of itself is a conduit for the Void's energies, one creates Voidic Cable. These cables will automatically connect to machines and each other when placed in the world. When connected to a something storing Voidic Power, they will relay
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicCable.pg2=it to all other machines they are connected to.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidBox=A special jukebox which was first designed by Void Liches. It is special in the sense that it can read any fully functional music disk. This music box can take input disks and be extracted from using other machines, such as a hopper. It also has an auto-insert function and will auto-play the next pending disc. This, paired with its loop functionality, can be used to easily create a space which always has music playing in the background.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicCharger.pg1=End Crystals are perhaps the most mysterious devices in the known universe. Aside from the fact that they are fragile and easily broken, all that is known of them is that they feed some sort of energy to the Ender Dragon to heal it. However, that is all you need to know to use them for your own purposes. By placing a Void Star in the center of an End Crystal, wrapping it in Void Cloth, and fortifying it with Void Infused Diamond Dust, one creates a Voidic
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicCharger.pg2=Charger. A device capable of charging certain items with Voidic Power. However, it should be noted that, due to its shape, it can only take in power from the Bottom. So plan accordingly when making your network of Voidic Generators and Voidic Cables.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicAnchor.pg1=It is known that the Voidic Charger can disperse Voidic Power to items, however there is a way to reverse this effect to draw Voidic Infusion from entities into liquid form. That is where the Voidic Anchor comes in. It requires Voidic Power to function itself, which can only be inputted from the bottom. In a 10 block radius it'll consume infusion from entities and turn it into Liquid Void. This Liquid void can only be extracted from the bottom as well.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicAnchor.pg2=Because both power and liquid void can only be accessed from the bottom it is recommended you place the Anchor right on top of a Voidic Power Generator.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicCrystallizer.pg1=The Voidic Crystallizer, as the name implies, takes Liquid Void and converts it back into Crystal form. It does however require power to function, 144 Voidic Power is needed per operation and ofcourse 1000mb (1 bucket) worth of Liquid Void is required. Both of these can only be inputted from the top and bottom of the machine. Crystals are thrown out of the machine into the world once formed.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.realityStabilizer=Throughout the Void, there are tears in space and time. It is unknown if these Holes in Reality occur naturally, or if they are the product some other powerful force. In either case, one may wish to remove them from the terrain for one reason or another. To do this, one must construct a powerful machine capable of containing these rifts. That is where this machine, the Reality Stabilizer, comes into play.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicAlchemyTable.pg1=Consuming Ethereal Fruit and their fertilized variants provide many great benefits. However, if brewing and farming in the Overworld has taught you anything, it would be that some of the most potent potions are created from enhanced crops. This holds true for the Voidic Plants as well. By encasing a Brewing Stand in Void Bricks and creating an interface of Void Cables and an Inert Void Infusion Altar, one creates a special workspace
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicAlchemyTable.pg2=specifically for brewing with these strange plants.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.realityTeleporterBlock.pg1=It is known that stepping into a Hole in Reality sends you to a random location as well as a random dimension. We also know we can collect these holes by stabilizing them with the Reality Stabilizer. With all of this information we can build ourselves a device that can use the power of these holes in reality for controlled teleportation.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.realityTeleporterBlock.pg2=To actually use the Reality Teleportation Block, you need at least two. Once you have two or more placed down you'll need to link them together, you do this by shift right clicking on the destination point (This will be the reality teleportation block you want to be sent to) with a Reality Teleporter item in hand. This will save the location to the item, you then need to shift right click on the block you wish to teleport from.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.realityTeleporterBlock.pg3=To clear the location from the item, open the GUI up and click on the button that says "Clear Link" this will clear the known link allowing you to create another link. Two teleporters will not automatically be linked both ways upon just linking one, you need to link both at different times. Just remember the first save is the destination point.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.realityTeleporterBlock.pg4=This will allow you to have multiple points linking to a single destination point as well as multiple point teleportation such as point A leads to point B, point B leads to point C, point C leads to point A, and so on. Both the point you are teleporting from and the destination point require at least 2000 Voidic Power and one Hole in Reality, these will get consumed when teleporting. All that's left is a redstone signal pulse to the block.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidcrystal=Crystallized Void, how exactly these formed and why they're found in The End is unknown. To gather these crystals, simply venture into The End and look around for Void Crystal Ore.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.ectoplasm=This ghastly material drops from Void Wraiths located inside the Void.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidChain=Dropped from Chained Spectres within the Void, these chains seem hollow. Perhaps it is due to their voidic nature
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.MoltenvoidChainPart=When one smelts a Void Chain the result is interesting. It is a ball of molten chain in which one would think would burn as you touch it, but in fact it is cool to the touch. The only explanation for this would be the voidic properties.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.MoltenvoidChain=Molten Chain Parts are far too pliable for any real purpose. That is where the fully formed Molten Chains come into play. Combine these parts with Charred Bones and you get a sturdy malleable chain capable of permanently changing shape as needed unlike the parts which revert back into a ball form.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.burnBone=Taken from your fallen enemies, the Void Wraths. These very sturdy creatures are nothing but bone, so it only makes sense for these bones to also be sturdy right?
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidStar=Very similar to the Nether Star. These are dropped from the Corrupted Pawn, in fact they are the cores of such beings. These stars are capable of opening rifts to the void but only when contained correctly. Strangely, if the star is surrounded by Soft Bedrock, it'll react and rip open a portal to an unknown world.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.emptyObsidianFlask.pg1=It is actually possible to collect 'Void' from within the Overworld. You need a special type of flask to do so. Simply get yourself some Empty Obsidian Flasks, head down near bedrock, and Right Click. What do these Flasks do you may ask? Well if you toss one (via right click) they explode on contact. They do not seem to damage the world at all but they cast a purple flame that does not seem to burn. It is a cold flame. Though coming in contact with such a flame
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.emptyObsidianFlask.pg2=yields interesting effects such as blindness and wither. This flame seems to last forever on Void Bricks.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidCloth=For some unknown reason the only way to obtain this cloth is from taking it from a lifeless corpse of a Void Lich. Though they were already undead to begin with. Even with the cloth in your possesion you can not figure out how exactly it is made or why it has the binding properties that it does. The material proves very useful though.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicsteel=Created in a Void Blast Furnace using Void Infused Iron Dust and Void Infused Coal Dust, this alloy is used to create various items and machines within VoidCraft. It should be noted that this is in the Ore Dictionary (as "ingotSteel") and may work with other mods that use Steel Ingots.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidDusts=Void Dusts are the result of using a Void Infused Macerator. Using the device with ores provides four dust. Using it with Ingots or Gems results in one. The types of dusts that can be obtained are Coal, Iron, Gold, Copper, Tin, Lead, Quartz, Emerald, Lapis, and Diamond. The non-gem based dusts can then be smelted into ingot form. This effectively allows, to an extent, quadruple ore processing.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.ChainedSkull=Oddly, covering a Wither's skull in Charred Bones followed by Molten Chains transforms the skull. You do not know if it is your mind playing tricks on you or if this skull is alive... breathing... speaking to you. It wants you to place it down. It tells you that you can end the world with it, that you should.                                                 Placing down the skull will result in explosions and a boss fight, be prepared.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicSuppressor=One of the few items that requires Voidic Power to function. To charge this device place it in a Voidic Charger. If this device contains power, it'll use that power to anchor the holder to the material plane. This means while in your hand or offhand the Voidic Suppressor will remove any Voidic Infusion on you and prevent more from being gained.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.corruptedPawn=Spawned into the world with a Chained Skull followed by an explosion. These deadly entities are very quick, deal massive damage and have a very large health pool. They attack most other creatures in sight. One must be very prepared before taking one on. Upon death, they drop their inner core, the Void Star.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.xia.pg1=By tossing a Void Star in the world and surrounding it in Soft Bedrock, something very strange happens. A red portal is ripped open to an unknown world. All that is known of this new world is that it is where the "Gods" reside. Perhaps taking on these so called gods may result in fortune.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicEssence=Raw Voidic Essence, this material will vanish when used and provides no use. Although, it resonates when near a very powerful being.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicDragonScale=Dropped from a Voidic Dragon. They can be used in Star Forged crafting.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.quoriFragment=A remnant from the Plane of Dreams. This strange fragment was held by the powerful being known as Xia for some strange unknown reason. It can be used in Star Forged crafting.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.astralEssence=An Essence of the Astral Plane. These can be found within Void Cities. As to why they are here in the first place, one can only guess. They can be used in Star Forged crafting.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicPhlogiston=Dropped by powerful Guardians in Void Cities. They can be used in Star Forged crafting.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.xiaArmor=Only obtainable from defeating Xia's first form, this armor has very high defense and grants the ability of flight. Only one piece needs to be equipped for flight, not the entire set.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.herobrine=The Avatar of Herobrine has 2 forms. In his first form he cannot take direct damage. Though while in this form strange pillars will form, these pillars can only take damage from direct hits from Herobrine himself. Each destroyed pillar will harm Herobrine. His second form resembles that of the Wither. In this form he can take direct damage.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.twins=The Twins do not like fighting. If possible, they will resort to various puzzles or mind games against their foes instead. Though, they do have the power to strike down their foes who let their guard down trying to solve such puzzles. The Twins will not just destroy without reason, they play fair and will only destroy if the challenge is failed.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.xiaBoss=Not much is known of Xia, what is known however is that he takes on two forms. The first being a humanoid form where he is susceptible to direct strikes. And his second form, which is more Djinn like. In his second form he is capable of maintaining a shield which protects him from all sources of damage. Though there are ways to bring down this protection momentarily.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidicDragon=Summoned by using a Void Star on a Dragon Egg. This variant of The Ender Dragon has 50 more health, deals an extra 5 damage (2 and a half hearts), and will drop Voidic Dragon Scales on death.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.voidShield=A Shield constructed from Crystallized Void. It has a durability of 2688.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.starforge.pg1=Located in the Realm of the Gods, The Star Forge is used to forge extremely powerful Tools and Weapons. They are forged from rare materials, these being: Cosmic Material, Voidic Dragon Scales, Quori Fragments, Astral Essence, and Voidic Phlogistons. These Tools and Weapons are so strong infact that they do not become dull or break. To craft a base, you must collect at least 4 Cosmic Material and a single Quori Fragment.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.starforge.pg2=It is also possible to forge effects onto these Tools and Weapons. Effects come in three tiers and once placed onto a tool or weapon, they cannot be overwritten or removed. So make your choices wisely. (Do note: More Effects may be added in the future)
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.starforge.effect.blindingFear=Targets are dealt with 10 seconds of Blindness each time they are hit.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.starforge.effect.firstDegreeBurns=Targets are set on fire for 30 seconds.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.starforge.effect.voidTouch=Adds 600 Voidic Infusion to targets.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.docs.desc.starforge.effect.xiaBlessing=Upon striking an enemy there is a 20 percent chance for the wielder to be healed for 5 hearts.

## -- Descriptions
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.dreams.pg1=This will be the last Task I give you. The benefit of this task is rather large. Instead of your health decreasing with Voidic Infusion, it will increase. Now what is the task? Defeat Xia.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.dreams.pg2=Destroy his current body, he is in a weak state right now. I must make my own preparations, this is where we part ways, mortal.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.empowerment=I've got a new task for you, it's pretty simple. Just hold a Void Star in your hand. Yup, that's all. This will give you more control over your infusion, you will deal increased damage based on the amount of infusion you have.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.improvedCasting.pg1=You can further decrease your chances of exploding from casting spells by another 25 percent. Just complete this task.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.improvedCasting.pg2=For your next task, simply venture into the Void and find a Void Fortress. Yes, it's that simple. It may be wise to collect a few charred bones while you're there.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.potions=Using your knowledge on Voidic Spells you can create potions that cause some interesting effects upon impacting against the ground. To craft these potions be sure to Shift Right click the Alchemical device with your Vade Mecum first. These are handy to share with those who cannot cast such spells unlike yourself.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.ritualBlock=These special blocks are used to invoke rituals for the Void Vade Mecum. The purpose of invoking a ritual is to gain new knowledge. To activate such a ritual simply construct one shown, then right click the Ritual Block with the Vade Mecum in hand. For your first ritual, just right click a lone placed ritual block. This will open up new knowledge within the Vade Mecum if not done so already.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.ritualList=This page will display the available rituals that can be invoked to advance your Vade Mecum Knowledge.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.tolerance.pg1=I've given you a new Word of Power, Invoke Infusion. Upon using this Word you will gain some infusion. For your next task, be outside of the Void, with Voidic Anchor active, use the new Word multiple times to reach maximum Voidic Infusion. Doing so will give you a new ability.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.tolerance.pg2=This ability, when active, will double your maximum amount of Voidic Infusion you can handle. This effectively allows you to hold onto this Infusion for twice as long or allows you to live through the Void without protection to Infusion twice as long.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.tome.pg1=As you invoke more and more rituals, you will gain Words of Power. A word, when spoken by Right Clicking with a ready Vade Mecum in hand, will cast magical effects. At least, it seems magical. The only explanation is that the Vade Mecum is opening small rifts to specific sections in the void to unleash such powers. Be wary, Voidic Magic is highly unstable and prone to explosions.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.tome.pg2=To ready your Vade Mecum for a Word you must first select a Word. This can be done by clicking on the Spells button on the bottom left of the Vade Mecum GUI. Words require materials, these can be inside the Vade Mecum itself or in your inventory. After you have a word ready to use, Shift Right Click in the world with your Vade Mecum in hand and it'll change in color. You are now ready to use the Word by Right Clicking normally with the Vade Mecum in hand.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.totalcontrol.pg1=Another task for you, this task will do quite a bit for you. You will decrease your explosion chance by another 25 percent, meaning you will no longer explode, and you will gain a new ability, Voidic Flight. This ability will allow you to gain flight at 25 percent infusion rather than 75 percent.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.totalcontrol.pg2=Your task may be a bit more challenging, you must reach up to the top of the Void to the Void Cities, get up high enough to where the Airships dock. Find and hold an Astral Essence in your hand. Be sure to bring a Potion of Plenum with you to survive the dangerous top layer of The Void.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.voice.pg1=I'm sure you've noticed each time you attempt to cast a spell that there's a very good chance you'll explode. Now you may be wondering where this text is even coming from, i'll just let you know that I, the Vade Mecum, am no ordinary book, but let's stay on topic.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.voice.pg2=Right onto the explosion bits, I have a task for you, doing this task will decrease the chance for you to explode by 25 percent, currently your chance is 75 percent. I'm sure your.. kind.. can do math, right? The task is simple, I want you to enter the Void and gain some infusion. It wont be much, but I'll let you know when your task is complete.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.voidicControl.pg1=You may know that Voidic Infusion inflicts some rather nasty effects upon you, however you may also know that some of these effects can be beneficial. There are ways to control your infusion effects in a way to prove more good than bad.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.voidicControl.pg2=Enter the Void and allow yourself to be consumed by the Voidic Infusion, I will anchor your body to the material plane to prevent death long enough for you to gain new power.
voidcraft.VadeMecum.progression.desc.infusionControl.main=This page will display your obtained Voidic Infusion Powers and will explain each one in detail.

voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.1.1=Â§3%sÂ§3 is approaching.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.1.2=Â§2I know.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.1.3=Â§3Isn't it strange? This one is actually able to be here because they changed the rules of our universe.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.1.4=Â§2Yes... While so many like %sÂ§2 are able to do this, so few choose to do so.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.1.5=Â§3I don't blame them. There isn't much information out there about us... yet.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.1.6=Â§2True, but to think... we're going to play a bigger part of this one's dream. %sÂ§2 will get to meet us.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.1.7=Â§3Will %sÂ§3 understand what we are?
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.1.8=Â§2I don't think so. We are the greatest mystery of all to humans. While this one is strong enough to understand our thoughts, it does not mean it will understand us in all our entirety.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.1.9=Â§3Let us take a form that is familiar to them, then.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.1.10=Â§2I agree.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.1.11=Â§2[Dol]: Hello, %sÂ§2.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.1.12=Â§2[Dol]: As you can tell, you are trapped in here.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.1.13=Â§3[Zol]: We'd like to have a little battle with you.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.1.14=Â§2[Dol]: Not just any battle.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.1.15=Â§3[Zol]: A battle of wits.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.1.16=Â§2[Dol]: If you pass our little challenge, we'll let you free. If Herobrine is also defeated, Xia's door will be open for you to proceed.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.1.17=Â§3[Zol]: Now then, shall we begin?
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.1.18=Â§3[Zol]: Place this sign, with your answer, in front of the chest and then flip the lever.
## -- 2
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.2.1=Â§3[Zol]: %sÂ§3 is correct, Dol.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.2.2=Â§2[Dol]: Yes indeed.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.2.3=Â§3[Zol]: We've got a few more for you, %sÂ§3.
## -- 3
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.3.1=Â§2[Dol]: %sÂ§2 is clever, Zol.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.3.2=Â§3[Zol]: We're not done yet though.
## -- 4
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.4.1=Â§3[Zol]: ...
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.4.2=Â§2[Dol]: How about this one?
## -- 5
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.5.1=Â§2[Dol]: What did this player dream?
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.5.2=Â§3[Zol]: This player dreamed of sunlight and trees. Of fire and water. It dreamed it created. And it dreamed it destroyed. It dreamed it hunted, and was hunted. It dreamed of shelter.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.5.3=Â§2[Dol]: Hah, the original interface. A million years old, and it still works. But what true structure did this player create, in the reality behind the screen?
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.5.4=Â§3[Zol]: It worked, with a million others, to sculpt a true world in a fold of the Â§kqwertyuiÂ§rÂ§3, and created a Â§kqwertyuiÂ§rÂ§3 for Â§kqwertyuiÂ§rÂ§3, in the Â§kqwertyuiÂ§rÂ§3.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.5.5=Â§2[Dol]: It cannot read that thought.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.5.6=Â§3[Zol]: It has not yet achieved the highest level. That, it must achieve in the long dream of life, not the short dream of a game.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.5.7=Â§2[Dol]: Sometimes I wish to tell them, this world you take for truth is merely Â§kqwertyuiÂ§rÂ§2 and Â§kqwertyuiÂ§rÂ§2, I wish to tell them that they are Â§kqwertyuiÂ§rÂ§2 in the Â§kqwertyuiÂ§rÂ§2. They see so little of reality, in their long dream.
voidcraft.twins.speech.riddle.5.8=Â§3[Zol]: %sÂ§3, go.. defeat Xia, only then will you achieve this so called "highest level".

voidcraft.twins.speech.end.1.1=Â§3Hello. Do you remember us?
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.1.2=Â§2Believe it or not, we've met before.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.1.3=Â§3In fact, we've never left your side.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.1.4=Â§2Though, I could imagine that our presence is all too subtle and overbearing for you to even acknowledge our presence.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.1.5=Â§3I wouldn't blame you. After all, it's easy to lose sight of reality while living in your dreams.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.1.6=Â§2We are the universe. We are everything you think isn't you.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.1.7=Â§3We are kind and loving, but Dol is not very humble.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.1.8=Â§2Were it not for me you'd use that line every chance you could, Zol.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.1.9=Â§3You're not wrong, but let's get back on topic.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.1.10=Â§2We are here because you've reached an even higher level, %sÂ§2.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.1.11=Â§2Youâve overcome great trial and tribulation, so weâve come to see you, player.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.1.12=Â§2To let you know that you played well.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.1.13=Â§3But the question remains: Have you reached the highest level?
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.1.14=Â§2That is something only you hold the answer to.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.1.15=Â§2Your potential is only barred by your own willpower.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.1.16=Â§3Your presence here is a testament to your character, but thereâs not much room for growth here.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.1.17=Â§3Perhaps youâll find the answers you seek by leaping into the abyss below.
## -- 2
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.1=Â§2Welcome back
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.2=Â§3What brings you here?
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.3=Â§2Do you enjoy overcoming challenges?
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.4=Â§3Do you seek a tangible reward for your efforts?
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.5=Â§2Or did you simply come to see us again?
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.6=Â§3Well, if itâs the latter, let us not disappoint.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.7=Â§2Letâs tell the player a story.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.8=Â§2Time started when there was change. As time flowed, or rather, as we came to be, you came to be as you are now.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.9=Â§3Us? We have been here since the beginning.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.10=Â§2...Though, to be truthful... You are just as old as we are.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.11=Â§3The difference, though, is that, in principle, we havenât changed.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.12=Â§3We were born from nothingness and thrust into a lawless world.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.13=Â§2And so, by our mere existence, we became law.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.14=Â§3We had a maker. Though, he neglected to tell us his name.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.15=Â§2We decided to call him "Xia"
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.16=Â§3He told us that we were to govern the realms that he also created.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.17=Â§3We knew not his of his intentions, but before him, we were nothing.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.18=Â§2So logically, we followed his order without hesitation.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.19=Â§2If he held the power to make us, he could easily eliminate us.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.20=Â§2After all, it is far more simple to destroy than it is to create. You of all people should know this by now.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.21=Â§3I, Zol, was to be the order which oversaw the development of the universe.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.22=Â§3From my intangible skies above, I would set the pace of time itself.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.23=Â§2I, Dol, was to give the universe form and function.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.24=Â§2I gave room for all worlds to exist, I even gave you space for your own.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.25=Â§3Together, we shaped the Universe as you know it.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.26=Â§3Everything that ever has, is, and will happen falls under our jurisdiction.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.27=Â§3Even your presence here today.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.28=Â§3We have been watching you form since you were just a random set of atoms.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.29=Â§3You were a part of many things before you were called %sÂ§3.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.30=Â§3You were once Dust, Rock, Star, Mountain, River, and Valley.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.31=Â§3You were also Microbe, Virus, Flora, and Fauna.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.32=Â§3And countless other things too, this is just to name a few.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.33=Â§2And in your previous forms, you did many things.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.34=Â§2Sometimes you sunbathed to convert the kinetic energy from photons into chemical energy in an extremely complex, yet beautiful process which your current form calls "Photosynthesis"
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.35=Â§2Sometimes you were hunting. Sometimes you were being hunted.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.36=Â§2Other times you were motionless. Either because you were dead or inanimate.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.37=Â§2Regardless of the form you took, however, there were some things that you always did throughout your entire existence.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.38=Â§3You changed.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.39=Â§2We mean that in both senses of the word.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.40=Â§3You have grown in character as much as you have grown as a body.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.41=Â§3Gathering together both the knowledge needed to succeed, and the nutrients you need to make your body stronger.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.42=Â§2You have also altered the world around you. Especially in this Short Dream of the game.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.43=Â§2We gave you the time and space you needed to do all of this.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.44=Â§2But the question remains: What will you do with it, if anything at all?
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.45=Â§2Only you hold the answer to that question.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.46=Â§2But even if you have plans, you will have to leap into action to leave this place.
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.47=Â§2There is nothing left for you here, so go...
voidcraft.twins.speech.end.2.48=Â§2Go out and live your dream.
