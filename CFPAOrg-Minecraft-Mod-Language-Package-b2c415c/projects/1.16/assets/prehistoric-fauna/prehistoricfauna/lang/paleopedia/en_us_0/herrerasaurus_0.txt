While I've been exploring for the 
past several weeks, I've been 
hearing a hissing noise coming 
from nearby, although I've never 
been able to locate where from 
until now. Today, I was able to spot 
a lone Herrerasaurus following me. 
The fact that I'm larger than 
anything they regularly hunt may 
be the only reason I'm alive. The 
patterning on it's back has helped 
keep it somewhat hidden from my 
view until now. Whether I'm safe or 
not is currently unknown. I yelled 
at it, and it ran off, seemingly 
scared, but it may come back.

Since having spotted the first 
Herrerasaurus, I've been able to 
spot more running through 
Ischigualasto. I was even lucky 
enough to have caught one eating 
a Hyperodapedon. Being as common 
as they are, Hyperodapedons are 
probably one of the main food 
sources for Herrerasaurus. 
Whether I'm being stalked or not is 
yet to be seen, but I'm feeling 
much more confident in my ability 
to spot them.
