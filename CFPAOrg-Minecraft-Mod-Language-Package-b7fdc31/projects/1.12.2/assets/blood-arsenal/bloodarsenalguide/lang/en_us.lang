guide.bloodarsenal.entry.lifebringer.intro.info.1=Hello Internet! Welcome to Gamâ€” Whoops! Wrong thing! Well, somehow you've managed to stumble across this weird mod but either way, the only reason you'll be reading this is because you have no clue what you're doing and you want to find out what to do! Right?!! As a heads up, I highly recommend you read the book that came with the parent of this mod, the &9Sanguine Scientiem&r or whatever fancy Latin words kids use these days. Make sure you have Just Enough Items (JEI) and the other mods installed yada-yada-yada to be able to use this guide to its full potential. Anyways, you're probably wondering who's the idiot that wrote this thing huh? With all the fourth-wall breaks and all that? Well, look no further as the author of this magically charred book is... me! That might not be as informative as you expected huh? My name is &4Arcaratus&r and this carefully written text will serve as your guide into the unknowns of the mystical and magical world of Blood Magic. Welcome to the realm of &4Blood Arsenal&r.
guide.bloodarsenal.entry.lifebringer.glassIsDangerous.info.1=Now, I'm sure that you've been told many times by many people that glass is dangerous. "But how?" you ask, "It's everywhere around me!" To which I respond, you're right! And it's dangerous! So don't play with it! But this is Minecraft and the realm of possibilities are endless. That includes the uses for &9Glass&r! Now I'm sure that now you've stepped into the beginnings of Blood Magic, you've seen how slow it can be to gather up LP in that fancy stone bucket that you call a &9Blood Altar&r. Sure there are some items such as the &9Blood Letter's Pack&r or you can use the fancy &9Incense Altars&r that Tiberius invented, but why not just delve deeper into what you already have? You can start your journey off by breaking &9Glass&r blocks while holding &9Flint&r in your hand, to which you will obtain &9Glass Shards&r. These little pointy things have great potential in aiding you in the sanguine arts. You can utilize these to craft yourself a &9Glass Sacrificial Dagger&r and a &9Glass Dagger of Sacrifice&r with your pre-existing ones. Not only are these piercingly transparent, they also result in more LP being gathered from their respective uses. Try them out!
