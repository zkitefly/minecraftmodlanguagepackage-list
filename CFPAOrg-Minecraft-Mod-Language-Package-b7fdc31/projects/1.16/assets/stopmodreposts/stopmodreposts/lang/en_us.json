Some of them also add malware to these files.\n \nIn order to be safe from such risks in the future, only download mods from trustworthy platforms, such as CurseForge or from transparent open-source platforms, such as Modrinth or GitHub. Make sure the author uploaded the mod themselves to the platform.\n\nPress the button on the left if you want to know more about this, and be safe in the future.
