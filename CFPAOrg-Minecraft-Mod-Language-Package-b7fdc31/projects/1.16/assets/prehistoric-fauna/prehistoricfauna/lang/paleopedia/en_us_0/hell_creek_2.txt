Clubmoss
Despite its name, Clubmoss is not 
an actual moss! These plants are 
closely related to ferns but are 
not nearly as common here as 
their ferny relatives. I've 
discovered that the Ankylosaurus 
enjoys this.

Marchantia
Marchantia seem to be a semi-rare 
plant that I've encountered here 
in Hell Creek. This plant is a type
of liverwort. They seem to be 
snacked on by Thescelosaurus.

Crassostrea
I am unsure whether to include this 
here, as they are technically an 
animal. These oysters are the 
same type of oysters I ate back 
home. They seem to be common in
lakes and rivers here. They 
appear to be commonly preyed 
upon by the small Didelphodon.
