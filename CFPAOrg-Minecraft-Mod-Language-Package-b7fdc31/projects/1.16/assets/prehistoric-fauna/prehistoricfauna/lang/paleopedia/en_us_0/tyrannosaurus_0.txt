Day: 32

While trying to look for more 
creatures to study, I heard very 
deep and loud growling noises 
echoing in the woods, which 
frightened me. After  recovering 
a bit, I realized out that it was 
the apex predator of these lands.
The speculations must've been 
true... The roar had a deep bass 
to it that would scare the life out 
of a human, even from afar.
I haven't seen one of them yet, but 
I have found large teeth near old 
Triceratops carcasses.

Day  39:

I found tracks that could only 
belong to Tyrannosaurus. I 
followed them and they lead to a 
small creek downhill, from there, 
nothing. I spent more time 
searching that day and right when 
the sun set, I saw one. The giant 
beast was walking down a valley 
with its younglings. The coloration 
of the specimen was a dark brown, 
with red impressions on the neck.

Regarding a feather coat, I only 
saw tiny patches of very small 
protofeathers that were barely 
visible. The infants that were 
walking along the parent, they 
were quite different from their 
bulky mother. They were quite 
agile, unlike the adult, and were
constantly doing something in the 
background.
