Upon entering the Triassic with the 
fossil I found, similar to the 
Jurassic and Cretaceous, I was hit 
by a wave of damp air. The sound 
of rainfall surrounded me, and I 
was quickly drenched in water. 
Looking at the flora, I am unable 
to tell exactly where I am. More 
research will have to be done 
before I can draw any conclusions. 
The environment of the area is 
very much like a rainforest, with 
lots of moisture and plant life. 
I must do more research here.

I encountered my first animal 
today, a prosauropod called 
Chromogisaurus. With this 
information, I've been able to 
deduce I'm in the Ischigualasto 
formation. If my memory serves me 
correctly, this formation boasts a 
large array of interesting fauna, 
and was prone to strong 
monsoons uncharacteristic of the 
giant desert continent it is in. 
I must keep my eyes open. Until 
then, I will record everything 
I discover.
