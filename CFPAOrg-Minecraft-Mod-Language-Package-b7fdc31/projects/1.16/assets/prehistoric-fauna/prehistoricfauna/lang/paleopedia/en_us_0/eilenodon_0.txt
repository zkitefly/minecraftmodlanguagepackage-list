When traveling across the 
savannah, I nearly stepped on 
a basking Eilenodon! Despite the 
fact they look like lizards, they 
are actually sphenodonts, like the 
modern day Tuatara. These 
interesting reptiles once inhabited 
almost all the niches of modern 
lizards, so it is interesting to see 
some now, when they were more 
common. As mentioned in the 
beginning of this page, like most 
other reptiles, they bask. When 
they get cold, they'll lay down in 
order to try and gain more heat 
from the ground.

The Eilenodon seem to eat the 
tough horsetails that sometimes 
grow throughout the Morrison. 
After giving some to one nearby, 
it ran off and began the creation 
of a nest.
