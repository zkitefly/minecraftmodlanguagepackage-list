Today on my journey, I 
discovered a large foot print 
in the sand. I noted the obvious 
theropod shape and size, and 
quickly deduced it must have been 
Allosaurus. The track was luckily 
old, so I felt somewhat safe. I do 
not believe I am ready to study an 
Allosaurus quite yet, with all my 
equipment left in the Cretaceous.

Despite what I wrote last week, I 
was unlucky enough to stumble 
across an Allosaurus eating. 
Luckily, it was more interested in 
it's Stegosaurus meal than it was in 
me. It's large size, green color, 
and large crests made it stand out 
against the bleak landscape. While 
beautiful, I do not wish to have 
another encounter with an 
Allosaurus for a long while.
