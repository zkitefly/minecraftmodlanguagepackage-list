I was on a walk today when I heard 
a guttural growling coming from 
behind me. Believing I had stumbled 
across a carnivore, I turned 
around slowly only to discover a 
small furry creature. While not a 
mammal, Exaeretodon is an ancient 
relative of mammals. While I 
remembered that they are 
herbivorous, this one had a mean 
disposition reminding me of 
wolverines and badgers, I backed 
away slowly. After putting another 
meter between us, the Exaeretodon 
wandered off into the brush. Being 
as mean as they are, I don't 
believe that Herrerasaurus try to 
hunt them. It will be difficult doing 
more research on them from a 
distance.

Fascinating! I was able to spot one 
whilst they were eating! Similar to 
the previously encountered 
Ischigualastia, the Exaeretodon 
seem to love Cladophlebis. Not 
only were they eating it, but they 
were using it to create small 
nests for their eggs. More 
research will have to be done.
