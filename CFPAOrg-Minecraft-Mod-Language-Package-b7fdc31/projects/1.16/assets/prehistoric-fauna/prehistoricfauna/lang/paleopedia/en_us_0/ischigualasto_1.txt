Plants of Ischigualasto

Araucaria
Wherever I go, it seems these 
trees are there. As with in 
the Jurassic, they are much 
smaller than the trees I found 
in Hell Creek. They aren't as 
common as they were in the 
Morrison though. I wonder if 
I'll ever discover how old 
they are?

Protojuniperoxylon
These are the most common trees 
I've discovered here in 
Ischigualasto. These giant trees 
grow over 40 meters tall here. 
While dwarfed by trees in Hell 
Creek, they are definitely nothing 
to scoff at. There also appears to 
be an abundance of smaller 
Protojuniperoxylons growing in the 
area as well. I wonder if these are
younger trees?

Dicroidium
These thin trees reach 5 meters 
tall, and are quite abundant 
here in Ischigualasto. My past 
research has taught me Dicroidium 
is a corystosperm, a long extinct 
kind of plant with  hard seeds and 
fronds like forked ferns. These 
interesting plants survived up 
until the early Jurassic, so it is 
always fascinating to see them at 
their prime. Their leaves appear 
to be like those of modern ferns, 
as we had previously believed, 
although much thicker.
