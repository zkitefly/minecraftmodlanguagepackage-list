[Stake](item:betterwithmods:stake)

The Stake is used for measuring and surveying land or for aesthetics.

Two collinear Stakes can be connected through string by right-clicking on the side of one of the stakes while facing the other.
This will use the same amount of string as blocks are between the two stakes allowing the player to quickly get a distance metric.
