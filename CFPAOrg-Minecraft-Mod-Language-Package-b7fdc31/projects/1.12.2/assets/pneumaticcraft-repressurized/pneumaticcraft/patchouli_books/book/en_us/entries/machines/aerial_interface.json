Only food items will be accepted by the Interface, and only when you're hungry enough to fully utilize the provided meal. Note that when an inventory offers a stack of >1, the Interface waits until you can consume that amount. To make sure the smallest amount of food can be utilized use slow inserters such as $(item)Hoppers/$."

This rate is 20mB/tick for all known fluids at the time of writing."
