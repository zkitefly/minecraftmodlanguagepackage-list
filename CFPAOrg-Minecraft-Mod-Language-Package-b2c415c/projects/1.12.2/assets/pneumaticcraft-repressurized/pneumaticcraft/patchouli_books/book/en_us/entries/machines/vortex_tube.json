It splits the $(l:base_concepts/pressure)air/$ flowing into it into $(l:base_concepts/heat)hot and cold/$ parts, heating up one side of the tube, and cooling down the opposite side. Be aware that the hot and cold sides do have a thermal connection, so it's more efficient to vent the cold side when you want to utilize the heat, and vice versa if you want to use the cold. This can be done with a $(l:machines/heat_sink)Heat Sink/$."

Higher pressure leads to greater temperature differentials, but air will also be used at a greater rate."
