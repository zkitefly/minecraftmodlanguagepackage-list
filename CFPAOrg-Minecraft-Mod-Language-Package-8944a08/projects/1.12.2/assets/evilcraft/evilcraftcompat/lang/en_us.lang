info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.baubles=Baubles
info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.baubles.text=The mod that adds several convenient new accessory slots to your player is also able to store the rings and pendants that are offered in this book. They still keep working as if they were inside your inventory. Baubles for everyone!

info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.blood_magic=Blood Magic
info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.blood_magic.text=One day I discovered a very strange &1Blood Orb&0 that must have been owned by some kind of &1Magician&0. When using it I felt like I was somehow connected to it. After a while I discovered that it was in fact connected to my &4Blood&0 stream. By forcing a large amount of &4Blood&0 through it using the &1Blood Infuser&0, I've managed to create an item that is both connected to my &4Blood&0 stream and can be used as a simple container, allowing me to place it in my favorite machines and using it with my items.

info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.ee3=Equivalent Exchange 3
info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.ee3.text=Magicians have discovered that almost all things in this world have some kind of &1value&0 relative to other things. These people have mastered the act of &1transmuting&0 these things to each other. Their strange methods even seem to work with my items.

info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.forestry=Forestry
info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.forestry.text=When &ovisiting&r some of my friends working with trees and bees, I noticed that some of their bags allow me to insert some of my items. I also noticed that their machine called the &1Squeezer&0 is able to extract &4Blood&0 from parts of the &1Undead Tree&0, which can be easily grown using their tree growing system.

info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.enderio=Ender IO
info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.enderio.text=These Ender-based technologies are very interesting, perhaps I could improve my machines based on that at some point. Eitherway, I seem to be able to process &1Dark Ore&0 and &1Dark Gems&0 using their machines, which is quite useful.

info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.ic2=Industrial Craft 2
info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.ic2.text=There is a group of odd people who constantly work with buzzing machines. I have no idea what these machines do, except for the &1Macerator&0. I am able to insert &1Dark Ore&0 into it to immediately retrieve &1Dark Gems&0 and their crushed variant. Regular &1Dark Gems&0 can also be inserted to crush.

info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.jei=Just Enough Items
info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.jei.text=Some people seem to have "&oToo Many Items&r", while others have "&oNot Enough Items&r". It seems like we finally reached a stage where people have "&oJust Enough Items&r", the knowledge from this book is understandable for them.

info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.immersiveengineering=Immersive Engineering
info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.immersiveengineering.text=I have to admit, the machines of those engineers look pretty neat. Other than that, they also appear to be very good in processing &1Dark Ore&0 and &1Dark Gems&0, but also in squeezing &1Undead Logs&0 and &1Undead Leaves&0 for &4Blood&0.

info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.thermal_expansion=Thermal Expansion
info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.thermal_expansion.text=These people are quite strange, they always wear very odd clothes and mostly seem to be wielding many types of wrenches for some reason. I know only one thing about them, they have a machine that can transpose fluids which allows for some very basic blood infusion, but unfortunately this can't be upgraded.

info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.thaumcraft=Thaumcraft
info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.thaumcraft.text=I have noticed Thaumaturgy to be a very different kind of magic. It looks like Thaumaturges are very happy when they see items of mine, they always walk around here with their strange hexagons. To please my friends, I have constructed some &1Veined Scribing Tools&0 which can be used to write with &4Blood&0 instead of ink.

info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.tinkers_construct=Tinkers' Construct
info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.tinkers_construct.text=&0Tools, tools and tools!&r It seems to be all these folks think about. Using nothing but these tools must damage them severely, luckily they have the &1Blood Chest&0 to repair them!

info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.waila=WAILA
info_book.evilcraftcompat.mod_integrations.waila.text=What are you looking at, you ask? You should be able to tell, really.
