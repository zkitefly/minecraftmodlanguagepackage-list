Much like the Great Minotaur, Cleavers patrol the maze-like hallways of nether fortresses, looking for fresh meat and lost souls to feast on. They carry with them a massive blade used to butcher any living creature they come across."

Cleavers have an undying rivalry with Bafometyrs, as both Lesser Demons compete over control of the fortress ruins. Cleavers only respect their king and his squires, as well as those who wear Besmirched Robes, and are willing to trade with their kingâ€™s squires."
