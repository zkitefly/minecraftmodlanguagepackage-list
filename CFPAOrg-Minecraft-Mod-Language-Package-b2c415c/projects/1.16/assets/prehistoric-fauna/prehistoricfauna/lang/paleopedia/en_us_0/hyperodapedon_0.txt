On my travels today, I discovered 
a small creature scrounging in the 
underbrush. It's stocky stature 
and large head make me believe 
that this is the rhynchosaur 
Hyperodapedon. Due to their small 
size, they are almost certainly 
commonly preyed upon by the 
larger carnivores of 
Ischigualasto. This would explain 
why it ran when it noticed me. I will 
have to keep my eyes out for more 
of these strange looking beasts.

Today I found a group of 
Hyperodapedon feeding on some of 
the low growing Scytophyllum. While 
these plants normally aren't 
accessible for the Hyperodapedon, 
they love it when they are able to 
get it. More research will be 
needed in the future.
