signals.tooltip.item.rail_network_controller=Shows an overview of the rail network of the world you are currently in. \n \nLeft clicking a signal forces it to turn green. \nRight clicking a signal forces it to go red.
signals.tooltip.item.cart_engine=Sneak-right-click with this on any cart. This will add a solid-fueled motor to the cart. Additionally, the engine is clever, meaning that it will automatically stop at red signals, without requiring powered rails, for instance.
signals.tooltip.item.chunkloader_upgrade=Sneak-right-click with this on any cart. This will add a built-in chunkloader to the cart, keeping a 3x3 area of chunks loaded, centered around the cart.
signals.tooltip.item.rail_configurator=This item is required for most interaction in Signals. Additionally it will show some information about the rail network. \n \nRight click carts to define destinations. \nRight click inventories to define filter matching behaviour when adjacent to Station Markers.
signals.tooltip.item.ticket=This item stores a set of destinations. These can be configured by right clicking the ticket or Station Marker. Apply it to a cart by right clicking it. Insert it into a Dispenser to automatically apply the destination.
