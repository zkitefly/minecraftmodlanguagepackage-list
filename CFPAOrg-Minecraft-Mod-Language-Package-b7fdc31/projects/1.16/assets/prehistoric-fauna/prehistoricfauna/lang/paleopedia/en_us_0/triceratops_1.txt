Day 67:
I've been eagerly waiting to
try to mount my good friend.
It's been a long time and
it's been growing quickly.
I made a saddle out of
Didelphodon hide, since
the keratinous back
wouldn't make up for a
Comfortable seat.

On my way to hunt some
Didelphodon, I've found a
Triceratops carcass. It was
Very peculiar, as I spotted
bite marks and teeth of a
young Tyrannosaurus. I
would guess this big one
died of natural causes.
Either way, I cut off its
horns, maybe I can use
them for something...

After I acquired the pelts
and stitched them together,
I was ready to hitch a ride
on my new dangerous
"pet".
