High-Pressure Refinery Unit
What's A Palladium Catalyst?
<&hydrotreater0>
The High-Pressure Refinery Unit (HPRU) is a multiblock machine that heats two fluids before combining them together for a fast reaction inside its high-pressure tank.

It uses within <config;i;hydrotreater_operationcost_lower> and <config;i;hydrotreater_operationcost_upper> IF/t.
These conditions make it ideal for three processes: cracking <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§opetroleum §n§oproducts§r;naphtha> into lighter ones, sulfur recovery from <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§osulfurized §n§opetroleum §n§oproducts§r;diesel>, and the dewaxing of <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§olubricant§r;lubricant> to make <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oparaffin §n§owax§r;paraffin>.

It is built as shown and formed by using the Engineering's Hammer on the Heavy Engineering Block in the Center

Applying a redstone signal to the control panel will halt the machine, this behavior can be inverted with the Screwdriver.

§2Sulfurized Diesel§r, §2Lubricant§r or §2Naphtha§r is pumped into the frontal port.

§2Water§r is pumped into the top.

§2Sulfur§r is dumped out the left port.

§2Diesel§r, §2Cracked Lubricant§r or §2Cracked Naphtha§r, depending upon feedstock, is pumped out of the top port on the left side.
