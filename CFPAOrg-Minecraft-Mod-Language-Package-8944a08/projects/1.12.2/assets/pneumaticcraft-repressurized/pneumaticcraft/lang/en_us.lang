########## GUI tabs

# Info
gui.tab.info=Information
gui.tab.info.assistIGW=For more detailed info, install IGW-Mod or Patchouli.

gui.tab.info.tubeModule=§0In this interface you can exactly define how a module should behave dependent on the redstone signal. You can define a formula.
gui.tab.info.heat=This machine requires or produces heat. Heat can be applied by placing a block that generates heat next to this machine. Think of a Vortex Tube (fast, but requires power), but also Lava (slow) and Torches (very slow). To cool down a machine, remove the heat sources and/or speed up the process by placing down Ice.
gui.tab.info.items=Add plastic in the bottom slot. In this slot plastic also will be put when it cools down into plastic. Add dye in the top slot. Note that when mixing dye with plastic, dye has a much lower effect than mixing another color of Plastic.
gui.tab.info.heat.title=Heat
gui.tab.info.ghostSlotInteraction=Interaction: \nAdd 1: right-click \nSubtract 1: left-click \nDouble: Sneak + right-click \nHalf: Sneak + left-click \nClear: Middle-click
gui.tab.info.ghostSlotInteraction.title=Slot interaction
gui.tab.liquidCompressor.fuel=Available Fuels

gui.tab.info.tile.aerial_interface=§0By using an advanced technology which compresses items so much they become as small as atoms, this machine can use a player's inventory as its own. This means you can hopper items in and out of this machine, and they will be added or removed to the inventory of the player who placed the block. Smarter insertion methods like Drones and/or Logistics Frames (or indeed other mods) could be used to keep the player's inventory supplied with 64 torches, for example.
gui.tab.info.tile.air_cannon=§0This machine can be used to transport items through the air. To be able to use it you'll have to make a GPS Tool. Once made, right click with it on the block you want the items to travel to, and insert the GPS Tool in the GPS slot.
gui.tab.info.aerialInterface.liquidXp.info.title=Interfacing XP
gui.tab.info.aerialInterface.liquidXp.info=§0With a Dispenser Upgrade installed in the Aerial Interface, you can pump liquid XP into or out of the Interface, directly filling or draining the player's stored experience. You can select which type of liquid XP to use with the above button; clicking it cycles through the available types, as well as the (default) disabled setting. \n \nAvailable XP types:
gui.tab.info.aerialInterface.interfacingRF.info.title=Interfacing Energy
gui.tab.info.aerialInterface.interfacingRF.info=The Aerial Interface accepts Forge Energy (compatible with RF and many other mods). The energy stored in its internal buffer (100,000 FE) is used to charge any chargeable item in the player's inventory at up to 1,000 FE/tick. \nNote: Energy is always interfaced regardless of whether or not a Dispenser Upgrade is inserted.
gui.tab.info.aerialInterface.interfacingFood=Interfacing Food & XP
gui.tab.info.aerialInterface.interfacingItems=Interfacing Items
gui.tab.info.aerialInterface.insertDispenser=Insert a Dispenser Upgrade to switch to interfacing food and experience.
gui.tab.info.aerialInterface.removeDispenser=Remove any Dispenser Upgrades to switch to interfacing items.

gui.tab.info.tile.pressure_tube=§0This block is used to transport air. It can be camouflaged and Tube Modules can be placed on it to provide additional functionality.
gui.tab.info.tile.advanced_pressure_tube=§0This block is used to transport air. It is the high tier version of the Pressure Tube. It can be camouflaged and Tube Modules can be placed on it to provide additional functionality.
gui.tab.info.tile.pressure_chamber_wall=§0This block is used to create a Pressure Chamber. Create a hollow 3x3x3/4x4x4/5x5x5 structure with at least one Pressure Chamber Valve in a face (not edge or corner) of the structure. Pressure Chamber Walls and Pressure Chamber Glass can be used interchangeably.
gui.tab.info.tile.pressure_chamber_glass=§0This block is used to create a Pressure Chamber. Create a hollow 3x3x3/4x4x4/5x5x5 structure with at least one Pressure Chamber Valve in a face (not edge or corner) of the structure. Pressure Chamber Walls and Pressure Chamber Glass can be used interchangeably.
gui.tab.info.tile.pressure_chamber_valve=§0This multi-block structure can be used as air storage. Its primary usage, however, is to compress various materials into other materials. Like Iron into Compressed Iron. Or Coal into Diamonds.
gui.tab.info.tile.elevator_frame=§0This block needs to be stacked on top of an Elevator Base to create a working Elevator.
gui.tab.info.tile.air_compressor=§0This machine is used to generate compressed air. To do this insert any solid-fuel item that can burn in a Furnace in the fuel slot. Note: fuel buckets will not work; use a Liquid Compressor for burning liquid fuels.
gui.tab.info.tile.advanced_air_compressor=§0This machine is the tier two version of the Air Compressor. Like its less resistant brother it can generate compressed air using any fuel that can burn in a Furnace. However, this one generates at 50mL/tick, and also produces heat. The higher the heat, the lower the efficiency. The bottom arrow in the temperature gauge indicates where the efficiency will start to drop, and the top arrow indicates the 0%% efficiency mark. \n \nUnlike you might expect from this mod, this machine won't explode when the temperature gets too high.
gui.tab.info.tile.charging_station=§0This machine is used to (dis)charge items which operate on pneumatic power, e.g. Drones, Pneumatic Wrenches and Vortex Cannons. It is also used to manage upgrades in those items which can accept upgrades.
gui.tab.info.tile.elevator_base=§0This machine is - like the name says - an elevator. You can use this to transport any entities. For it to work you'll need some air pressure and Elevator Frames on top of this block to support the elevator. To control the height level apply a redstone signal or use Elevator Callers. A redstone strength of 0 equals 0%% extension, a strength of 15 equals 100%% extension. \n \nYou can extend your elevators sideways. When you connect them in a way that the topmost Elevator Base for every elevator is at the same height, they will share the floor names/desired heights. \n \nThis block, and Elevator Callers, can be camouflaged with the Camouflage Applicator tool.
gui.tab.info.item.pneumatic_helmet=§0On its own this helmet is slightly better than an Iron Helmet. However, you can install various upgrades here to unlock many useful extra features.
gui.tab.info.item.pneumatic_chestplate=§0On its own this chestplate is slightly better than an Iron Chestplate. However, you can install various upgrades here to unlock many useful extra features.
gui.tab.info.item.pneumatic_leggings=§0On its own these leggings are slightly better than Iron Leggings. However, you can install various upgrades here to unlock many useful extra features.
gui.tab.info.item.pneumatic_boots=§0On its own these boots are slightly better than Iron Boots. However, you can install various upgrades here to unlock many useful extra features.  The Boots provide step assist functionality for free (no upgrade, no air cost); this can be disabled in the Pneumatic Armor GUI if you don't like step assist.  The boots also negate fall damage at a small air cost.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.head.searchUpgrade=§0The Search Upgrade allows you to search for a specific item in (for example) your base. This upgrade depends on the Block Tracker, to be able to find the item existing in inventories, and on the Entity Tracker, which allows it to find the searched item when it lies on the ground. To experience the full effect of the upgrade you should install both these upgrades.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.head.coordinateTrackerUpgrade=§0The Coordinate Tracker upgrade allows you to track one specific coordinate, which can be used for example when you are tunneling to a certain location, without knowing the exact place this location is at in relation to where you are at that moment. Meant for people that don't like to use F3. As second feature this upgrade will use Minecraft's entity pathfinding to navigate you to wherever you want.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.head.entityTrackerUpgrade=§0With the Entity Tracker upgrade in, the helmet is able to track any living entity within a range of 16 blocks. These entities don't have to be visible, making this upgrade a perfect way to prevent Creepers sneaking up on you.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.head.blockTrackerUpgrade=§0With the Block Tracker you'll be able to track Chests, Mob Spawners, Furnaces, Silverfish Blocks, Tripwires, Dispensers, TNT and End Portal Blocks within a range of 30 blocks. This way Dungeons, Fortresses and temples can easily be found. Inventories can even be remotely examined, as hovering over one of these indicators will show their inventories.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.head.speedUpgrade=§0With Speed Upgrades installed, the helmet will initialize its systems faster when equipped and lock onto blocks/entities faster (with the Block Tracker or Entity Upgrade installed, respectively).  Multiple Speed Upgrades can be installed to further reduce the initialization time, but air usage will increase.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.head.rangeUpgrade=§0Range Upgrades increase the range at which the Block and Entity Tracker Upgrades can operate.  Up to 5 Range Upgrades can be installed, and each upgrade increases the range by 5 blocks (but also increases the air usage).
gui.tab.info.item.armor.head.securityUpgrade=§0With one or more Security Upgrades installed, you gain the ability to §ohack§0 various blocks and entities in the world with the hacking hotkey (default: H).  Hacking has a variety of useful effects; try targeting things in the world with a Block and/or Entity Tracker Upgrade also installed.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.head.dispenserUpgrade=§0When used in conjunction with the Entity Tracker upgrade, the Dispenser Upgrade allows debugging & monitoring of active drones; target a drone and use the drone-debug hotkey (default: Y), then open the helmet options GUI (default: U). \n \nA redstone particle effect will also be displayed in any blocks that nearby (within 32 blocks) drones are interested in.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.head.thaumcraftUpgrade=§0With a Thaumcraft Upgrade installed, you gain the benefits of Goggles of Revealing: nodes are revealed, you get a 5%% Vis discount, and essentia levels of various containers are displayed on-screen.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.head.night_visionUpgrade=§0As its name suggests, the Night Vision upgrade allows you to see clearly in the dark, for a minor air cost. A single upgrade is sufficient.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.head.scubaUpgrade=§0This upgrade allows you to breathe underwater, using air stored in your helmet. Note that this is less efficient in terms of air usage than an Aerial Interface, but also more... self-contained.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.chest.magnetUpgrade=§0With a Magnet Upgrade installed, your chestplate can automatically pull nearby items toward you for a small air cost.  You can install up to 6 Magnet Upgrades to extend the magnet's range.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.chest.chargingUpgrade=§0With one or more Charging Upgrades installed, your chestplate can automatically charge all other pressurizable items in your inventory, either worn or carried (note: will only charge items with a lower pressure than the chestplate).  Up to 6 Charging Upgrades can be installed to increase the charging rate.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.chest.securityUpgrade=§0With a Security Upgrade installed, you will gain protection from fire and lava at a significant air cost: air will be rapidly dumped from the chestplate to extinguish nearby flames and solidify nearby lava.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.chest.dispenserUpgrade=§0With one or more Dispenser Upgrades installed, you gain the ability to launch items and blocks from your offhand slot by pressing and releasing the launch key (Control + C by default). \n \n• Some items and blocks are handled specially, deploying the item/block as an entity, similar to the way a Dispenser would operate. \n• Items which don't have special handling will simply be launched as item entities. \n• Blocks which don't have special handling will be launched as "tumbling block" entities, which will try to reform as blocks on impact with any other block. \n \nUp to four Dispenser Upgrades can be installed for greater launch distances.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.chest.air_conditioningUpgrade=§0Air Conditioning Upgrades help regulate your body temperature, protecting it from hot or cold extremes caused by Tough As Nails. The chestplate can take up to four upgrades for a cumulatively more powerful effect, but be aware that this is at the cost of air usage; the more heating or cooling required, the greater the air usage.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.legs.speedUpgrade=§0With one or more Speed Upgrades installed in your leggings, you will be able to run faster.  Up to 3 Speed Upgrades can be installed for progressively faster speeds (and higher air usage).
gui.tab.info.item.armor.legs.rangeUpgrade=§0With one or more Range Upgrades installed in your leggings, you will be able to jump higher.  Up to 6 Range Upgrades can be installed for progressively higher jumps (and higher air usage).  Holding Sneak while jumping will reduce the jump height to be equivalent to a single Range Upgrade.  Fall protection is included (no need to wear Pneumatic Boots).
gui.tab.info.item.armor.feet.dispenserUpgrade=§0With a Dispenser Upgrade installed in your boots, you can kick entities in front of you at a modest air cost.  Kicked entities will take moderate damage and heavy knockback. Up to 4 upgrades can be installed; more upgrades will increase damage & knockback, but also increase air usage. \n \nThis works on non-living entities too...
gui.tab.info.item.armor.feet.jetbootsUpgrade=§0With one or more Jet Boots Upgrades installed in your boots, you gain limited flying ability for a significant air cost.  When the upgrade is enabled, holding the Jump key (Space by default) will propel you in the direction you're looking.  When Jump is not held, you will slowly and safely descend to the ground (hold Sneak for faster descent).  Up to 10 upgrades can be installed for faster flight (and - of course - greater air usage).
gui.tab.info.item.armor.generic.speedUpgrade=§0Each Speed Upgrade installed reduces this armor piece's startup time.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.generic.volumeUpgrade=§0Each Volume Upgrade installed increases this armor piece's air storage capacity by 5000mL over the base 12000mL, allowing the piece to operate longer between recharges.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.generic.itemLifeUpgrade=§0Item Life Upgrades allow this armor piece to be slowly auto-repaired, at a cost of air.  Up to 5 Item Life upgrades can be installed in each armor piece for faster repair (but progressively more inefficient air usage).
gui.tab.info.item.armor.generic.armorUpgrade=§0Armor Upgrades add a small amount of armor protection to the armor piece.  2 upgrades will bring the armor level up to Diamond Armor level.  A maximum of 6 Armor Upgrades can be installed for excellent protection.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.generic.airConditioningUpgrade=§0Air Conditioning Upgrades help to regulate your body temperature for a moderate air cost. Each armor piece will help to cool or warm you as necessary to maintain a comfortable body temperature. This is most effective with Air Conditioning Upgrades installed in all pieces, but every little helps.
gui.tab.info.item.armor.generic.thaumcraftUpgrade=§0With a Thaumcraft Upgrade installed, you get a Vis discount equivalent to the corresponding Thaumaturge's Armor piece.
gui.tab.info.item.drone=§0In this interface you can insert upgrades into the Drone. Open up other tabs to see which enhancements can be done.
gui.tab.info.item.drone.speedUpgrade=§0For each Speed Upgrade inserted, the movement speed of the Drone will increase by 10%% of its base speed. This can stack up to 10 upgrades, so 200%% speed is the max.
gui.tab.info.item.drone.dispenserUpgrade=§0By default the Drone can carry one stack of items. For every Dispenser Upgrade inserted, the Drone gains an additional slot in its internal storage. \n \nIt will also increase the internal liquid tank by 16000mB per upgrade, and 100000RF storage per upgrade (if installed). It also increases the rate at which the Drone can transfer RF (transfer = max storage / 100). \n \n§lNote§0: only applies to regular (programmable) Drones. Logistics & Harvester Drones can not use Dispenser Upgrades.
gui.tab.info.item.drone.itemLifeUpgrade=§0With the Item Life Upgrade inserted, the Drone will be able to auto-repair. It will regen health over time. The more upgrades you insert, the stronger the effect (up to 6 upgrades).
gui.tab.info.item.drone.magnetUpgrade=§0With the Magnet Upgrade inserted, the Drone will automatically pick up nearby items, if it has free inventory space. The range is 2 blocks, increasing by 1 block per inserted upgrade (up to 5 upgrades).
gui.tab.info.item.drone.securityUpgrade=§0With one Security Upgrade inserted, the Drone can breathe in liquids; with two upgrades, liquids around the Drone will be temporarily displaced away; with three (or more) upgrades, liquids will be permanently removed. \nThe Drone will not willingly enter lava, regardless of Security Upgrades. \n \nOne or more Security Upgrades will also provide Drones with protection from electrical damage from uninsulated Immersive Engineering wiring; this also comes with an air cost, proportional to the damage negated.
gui.tab.info.item.drone.volumeUpgrade=§0For each Volume Upgrade inserted, the Drone's air volume will be increased by 5000mL. This could be useful for long journeys.
gui.tab.info.item.drone.entityTrackerUpgrade=§0When inserted, the Drone will have a minigun attached to it, allowing it to perform ranged attacks (up to 16 blocks from the target) when an Entity Attack piece is used. Gun Ammo is required to fire, which needs to be imported with an Inventory Import piece.
gui.tab.info.item.drone.rangeUpgrade=§0Increases the range of the ranged attacks of the Drone (requiring an Entity Tracker Upgrade) by one block per upgrade (up to 16 upgrades).
gui.tab.info.item.minigun.speedUpgrade=§0Allows the minigun to spin up faster, reducing delay before firing, and also adds a small chance of firing multiple rounds at once. This incurs a significantly increased air cost. Up to three Speed Upgrades can be added.
gui.tab.info.item.minigun.rangeUpgrade=§0Increases the minigun's range. Up to six upgrades can be added; each upgrade adds 5 meters to the base range of 50 meters. Increased range comes at an increased air cost.
gui.tab.info.item.minigun.dispenserUpgrade=§0Increases the chance of ammo effects (potions, explosive, freezing etc.) being activated. This can significantly increase air usage, depending on the ammo type in use. Up to three Dispenser Upgrades can be added for an increased activation chance.
gui.tab.info.item.minigun.entityTrackerUpgrade=§0Zooms the player view when the minigun is activated. Up to four upgrades can be added for increased zoom. This has no extra air cost.
gui.tab.info.item.minigun.itemLifeUpgrade=§0Slowly replenishes any ammo in the minigun's magazine, but at a very steep air cost. Up to four Item Life Upgrades can be added for faster ammo replenishment, but exponentially greater air usage.
gui.tab.info.item.minigun.securityUpgrade=§0Prevents the minigun from damaging tamed entities and other players. This has no extra air cost.
gui.tab.info.tile.pressure_chamber_interface=§0This block can be used to import/export items to/from a Pressure Chamber. It imports on the 'I' face, and exports on the 'O' face (so have the 'O' face pointing to the outside world). Use the filter slots to select which items may be imported/exported.
gui.tab.info.tile.vacuum_pump=§0This machine is used to achieve a vacuum. To do this this machine uses pressurized air. Apply pressurized air at the '+' tube, and when 2 bar is reached, air at the '-' tube will be sucked.
gui.tab.info.tile.assembly_controller=§0This machine is used to control other assembly machines. It can control any connected assembly machine, and the machines connecting these assembly machines, and so on... To start the assembly put a program in the program slot.
gui.tab.info.tile.assembly_io_unit=§0Part of an Assembly line. Imports items from an inventory to an Assembly Platform, or exports items to an inventory. Hit it with a wrench to switch between the modes.
gui.tab.info.tile.assembly_platform=§0Part of an Assembly line. Holds the items so that they can be drilled/lasered.
gui.tab.info.tile.assembly_drill=§0Part of an Assembly line. Can drill items on an Assembly Platform adjacent to it. It cannot be set up diagonally in relation to the Assembly Platform!
gui.tab.info.tile.assembly_laser=§0Part of an Assembly line. Can laser items on an Assembly Platform adjacent to it. It cannot be set up diagonally in relation to the Assembly Platform!
gui.tab.info.tile.uv_light_box=§0With this machine you can expose Empty PCB's to UV light. If this happens in such a way that only a part of the PCB gets exposed, this part will hold it's copper traces when etched in an Etching tank. The longer you expose a PCB, the higher the chance that the PCB will be successfully etched.
gui.tab.info.tile.security_station=§0When you want to protect an area from others messing around with your belongings, you can use this block to prevent others from interacting/breaking with every block within its range. You can whitelist players by adding them in the Access Stat. There's no in-game tutorial available just yet for how to set up the network.
gui.tab.info.tile.security_station.hacking=§0In here you can hack a Security Station. You start at the IO Port. From there, you can hack Network Nodes by left-clicking on them. Every time you do so, you have a chance to be detected by the Diagnostic Subroutine, which then will initiate a trace. You lose when the Subroutine has found your IO Port. You win when you've either hacked every Subroutine or every Registry.
gui.tab.info.tile.security_station.stopWorm=§0With a STOP! Worm you can stop a Diagnostic Subroutine from tracing you for 5 seconds. This software will be used in the process. To use it click on the STOP! Worm icon on the right when you are detected (else it would serve no purpose).
gui.tab.info.tile.security_station.nukeVirus=§0The Nuke Virus is a consumable item which can be used to insta-capture (without time loss) a Network Node without any chance of being detected by the Diagnostic Subroutine. This also works with every other Network component. To use it, middle-click a hackable node.
gui.tab.info.tile.security_station.hacking=§0In here you can hack a Security Station. You start at the IO Port. From there, you can hack Network Nodes by left-clicking on them. Every time you do so, you have a chance to be detected by the Diagnostic Subroutine, which then will initiate a trace. You lose when the Subroutine has found your IO Port. You win when you've either hacked every Subroutine or every Registry.
gui.tab.info.tile.universal_sensor=§0Like the name suggests, you can use this device as sensor in many applications. To select a sensor, put in the right Upgrades and navigate through the folder structure. Sensors are marked with a yellow button text. The Block and GPS Tool sensors emit a redstone signal dependent on a location. When two GPS Tools are inserted, the locations of the Tools form the corners of a box, and every coordinate in this box is used in the measurement. The measuring interval is decreased when using multiple coordinates (does not apply for event based sensors like the Player right click sensor). Both GPS Tools need to be in range of the sensor.
gui.tab.info.tile.pneumatic_generator=§0This machine converts compressed air into Industrial Craft 2 EU. You can interact with this machine with an IC2 Wrench just like any other IC2 machine.
gui.tab.info.tile.electric_compressor=§0This machine converts Industrial Craft 2's EU into compressed air. You can interact with this machine with an IC2 Wrench just like any other IC2 machine.
gui.tab.info.tile.electrostatic_compressor=§0In the real world it has been stated it's incredibly difficult to do, but here it's a reality: creating energy from lightning. When this compressor is hit by lightning, it produces 200,000 mL of air instantly. To increase the chance of a strike, place down a grid of Iron Bars connected to this compressor. \n \nNotes: \n• You can place multiple Electrostatic Compressors on the same grid, and the incoming air will be shared amongst them. \n• The grid of Iron Bars is effective out to 5 blocks horizontally (circular radius) and 5 blocks vertically from the compressor. The more bars (to a maximum of 250 per grid), the better the chance of a strike. \n• You can also improve the chances of a strike by adding a lightning rod: a column of up to 10 iron bars directly above the compressor. \n• To dissipate excess energy (and a potential explosion), add a column of Iron Bars directly below the compressor to ground it. The number of bars needed depends on the number of connected compressors (see the "Electrostatic Info" tab opposite). \n• The chances of a lightning strike are very poor in clear weather, better when raining, and much better in a thunderstorm.
gui.tab.info.tile.electrostatic_compressor.short=§0Generates (a lot of) air from lightning strikes. See the GUI information tab for much more information.
gui.tab.info.tile.pneumatic_door_base=§0This machine, when placed next to (the top half of) a Pneumatic Door, will automatically open the door when there are players nearby. When the Pneumatic Door Base is within range of a Security Station, the Pneumatic Door Base will only react to players which are allowed by the Security Station. This block can be camouflaged with the Camouflage Applicator tool.
gui.tab.info.tile.pneumatic_door=§0This block is used together with a Pneumatic Door Base to form a working door contraption.
gui.tab.info.tile.omnidirectional_hopper=§0Did you ever want to use Hoppers to extract items from a side other than the bottom of an inventory? Or did you wish that the Hopper could transfer items faster? Then this Omnidirectional Hopper is for you. Apart from orienting it in any direction you want, it can also be upgraded like other PneumaticCraft machines. \n \nYou can configure the input and output directions with a wrench: \n- Right-click to rotate the input \n- Sneak-right-click to rotate the output
gui.tab.info.tile.flux_compressor=§0This block can convert Forge Energy (compatible with RF and many other mods' energy) into compressed air. By default it has an efficiency of 40%%. The input FE rate is twice the amount of FE used per tick to generate air.
gui.tab.info.tile.pneumatic_dynamo=§0This block can convert compressed air into Forge Energy (compatible with RF and many other mods' energy). By default it has an efficiency of 40%%. The output FE rate is twice the amount of FE created per tick.
gui.tab.info.tile.liquid_compressor=§0This machine can generate compressed air using various liquids. To see every possible fuel open up the 'Available Fuels' tab. This tab is ordered from best to worst fuel. \n \nYou can either pump in fuel, right click with a fluid container (like a bucket) on the Liquid Compressor, or put the fluid container in the top slot.
gui.tab.info.tile.advanced_liquid_compressor=§0This machine is the tier two version of the Liquid Compressor. Like its less resistant brother it can generate compressed air using liquid fuel (all useable fuels can be seen in the 'Available Fuels' tab). However, this one generates at 50mL/tick, and also produces heat. The higher the heat, the lower the efficiency. The bottom arrow in the temperature gauge indicates where the efficiency will start to drop, and the top arrow indicates the 0%% efficiency mark. \n \nUnlike you might expect from this mod, this machine won't explode when the temperature gets too high.
gui.tab.info.tile.plastic_mixer=§0The Plastic Mixer is used to melt down Plastic into liquid plastic, or to solidify liquid plastic into Plastic. Using red, green and blue dye any color of Plastic can be crafted. Just supply these dyes and click on the desired color of Plastic in the 'Item Selection' tab. Note that White Plastic doesn't require any dye.
gui.tab.info.tile.liquid_hopper=§0The Liquid Hopper is a hopper which you can use to transfer liquids. Like the Omnidirectional Hopper it's omnidirectional. \n \nApart from transferring liquids from one tank to another, the Liquid Hopper will also try to empty any liquid container (like a Bucket) lying at the input side. Likewise it'll try to fill any liquid container at the output side.
gui.tab.info.tile.programmable_controller=§0A Programmable Controller is a machine you can use as a replacement for a Drone. Program either a Network API or Drone and place it in the gear slot. At rate of 10mL air per tick, the controller will execute most program pieces (see "Excluded Pieces" tab for more info on what is not accepted). Items and liquids can be interfaced through the block as well as through programming. \n \nA major benefit of this machine is that it does not involve any entity pathfinding.
gui.tab.info.programmable_controller.excluded=Excluded Pieces
gui.tab.info.tile.gas_lift=§0A Gas Lift is a type of pump which uses pressure to pump up liquids. When placed down it requires pressure and Pressure Tubes to operate. The Gas Lift places Pressure Tubes or Advanced Pressure Tubes downwards until it hits a liquid. When solid blocks are encountered they will be dug; this uses pressure, proportional to the block's hardness (Advanced Pressure Tubes use up less pressure). The minimum pressure required to operate increases proportionally to the working depth.
gui.tab.info.tile.refinery=§0A Refinery is used to process a fluid into different fluids, for example Diesel, Kerosene, Gasoline, LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) can be processed from oil. LPG is used in a Thermopneumatic Processing Plant to produce Plastic. \n \nEither 2, 3 or 4 Refineries need to be stacked on top of each other to work. With two Refineries Diesel is produced in the bottom Refinery, and LPG in the top. With 4 Refineries all fuels are produced. The latter is much more efficient. The more heat you apply to the Refinery the faster it runs.
gui.tab.info.tile.thermopneumatic_processing_plant=§0A Thermopneumatic Processing Plant is used to process liquids into other liquids. LPG and Coal together in this machine can produce Liquid Plastic. It can also be used in fuel cracking. Heavy fuels can be cracked into lighter ones. This means Diesel can be turned into Kerosene, Kerosene into Gasoline and Gasoline into LPG.
gui.tab.info.tile.compressed_iron_block=§0A block used as crafting component. Apart from that it serves as an excellent heat conductor.
gui.tab.info.tile.aphorism_tile=§0This block acts as a sign. However, it is capable of storing theoretically infinite amounts of text. It scales the text to so the text will always fit.  Right-click with any dye to recolor the tile; you can color the border and background independently.
gui.tab.info.tile.aphorism_tile.color=Self-craft to remove dyes
gui.tab.info.tile.elevator_caller=§0This block is used in combination with Elevator Bases and Elevator Frames.
gui.tab.info.tile.programmer=§0This block is required to program Drones. It uses puzzle pieces to define a program.
gui.tab.info.tile.creative_compressor=§0A creative-only block used to generate any pressure you would like to test set-ups.
gui.tab.info.tile.heat_sink=§0Block that disperses heat into the air. It only connects to the block it's on (not simply adjacent to). When an Air Grate Tube Module is pointed at it, its effectiveness is greatly increased.
gui.tab.info.tile.vortex_tube=§0Splits incoming air into hot and cold components. One side will be heated, the other cooled. Its air usage is dependent on the pressure. Mind that heat will slowly leak between the hot and cold sides, so it's more efficient to vent the cold side when you want to utilize the heat, and vice versa if you want to use the cold.
gui.tab.info.tile.drone_interface=§0A block that allows ComputerCraft and OpenComputers to interface with Drones.
gui.tab.info.tile.kerosene_lamp=§0A Kerosene Lamp is a light source that runs on Kerosene. It is similar to the long range light sources you might be used to, like Thaumcraft's Arcane Lamp, or Factorization's Wrath Lamp.
gui.tab.info.tile.sentry_turret=§0A Sentry Turret is an autonomous defensive weapon. When provided with Gun Ammo it will fire at any living entity within a 16 block range (extendable with Range Upgrades). You can filter which entities to attack by entering a filter in the 'Target Filter' field. When the Sentry Gun is covered by a Security Station, players allowed by the Security Station will not be targeted.
gui.tab.info.tile.thermal_compressor=§0A Thermal Compressor converts temperature differentials on opposite sides of the block to compressed air. Place a high-temperature block on one side of the compressor and a low-temperature block on the opposite side. \n \nNote that the North-South faces are thermally connected to one another, as are the East-West faces, but there is no cross-connection from NS to EW. Thermally connected sides will attempt to equalize the temperature, so effort is needed to maintain a good temperature differential.

gui.tab.info.logistic_frame_requester=§0Requester frames can request resources from any other framed inventory. \n \nHere you can specify the resources and quantities that Logistics Drones / Logistics Modules should keep stocked in the framed inventory. Either insert items from your inventory, or search for an item/fluid by right clicking an empty slot.
gui.tab.info.logistic_frame_passive_provider=§0Passive Provider frames can provide resources to Requester Frames. \n \nBy default the framed inventory will provide every item in the inventory. By adding items to this filter, only those items will be provided. Add items from your inventory, or search for an item/fluid by right clicking an empty slot.
gui.tab.info.logistic_frame_active_provider=§0Active Provider frames can provide resources to Requester frames and Storage / Default Storage frames. \n \nBy default the framed inventory will provide every item in the inventory. By adding items to this filter, only items specified will be provided. Add items from your inventory or search for an item/fluid by right clicking an empty slot.
gui.tab.info.logistic_frame_storage=§0Storage frames can receive resources from Active Providers and supply resources to Requesters. \n \nBy default the framed inventory accepts any item from providing inventories. By adding items to this filter, only items specified can be inserted via the logistics network. Add items from your inventory or search for an item/fluid by right clicking an empty slot.
gui.tab.info.logistic_frame_default_storage=§0Default Storage frames can receive resources from Active Providers and supply resources to Requesters and Storage Frames. They have a lower priority than Storage frames, which will be always be used first if possible. \n \nBy default the framed inventory will accept any resources from providing inventories. By adding items to this filter, only items specified can be inserted via the logistics network. Add items from your inventory or search for an item/fluid by right clicking an empty slot.

# Upgrades
gui.tab.upgrades=Upgrades
gui.tab.upgrades.volume=§7§nVolume Upgrade \n§0Adds 5L more air capacity for each upgrade inserted.  Adding volume upgrades will increase the air that can be stored, causing a pressure drop.  Removing upgrades will keep the pressure constant, losing air from the machine.
gui.tab.upgrades.volumeCapacity=§7§nVolume Upgrade \n§0Increases the heat capacity of this machine. It will heat up slower, but it also will cool down slower.
gui.tab.upgrades.security=§7§nSecurity Upgrade \n§0Adds a built-in Safety Valve Tube to the pneumatic machine.
gui.tab.upgrades.creative=§d§nCreative Upgrade \n§0Allows the hopper to provide items/fluids infinitely.
gui.tab.upgrades.tile.aerial_interface=§7§nDispenser Upgrade \n§0Allows interfacing of Food & Experience instead of items. Only food items will be accepted through the Aerial Interface; see the Feed Mode tab opposite for how the food is handled. \n \nIf a suitable XP fluid is available, it can be pumped in or out of the Aerial Interface and will convert to or from player levels.  See the Interfacing XP tab opposite to choose which fluid type to use.
gui.tab.upgrades.tile.air_cannon=§7§nDispenser Upgrade \n§0Will make the cannon act like a Dispenser. Any item that would act special in a Dispenser, will be handled the same way in here. \n§7§nEntity Tracker Upgrade (max = 5) \n§0When fired, the Air Cannon will grab the closest living entity and shoot it to the set coordinate. This can be used as player transport. It has a grabbing radius of 1 by default. Per inserted Entity Tracker Upgrade the radius will increase by one. \n§7§nBlock Tracker Upgrade \n§0When fired, items being shot automatically will try to go into inventories they hit. When firing at a Chest for example, items will land in the Chest without needing a Hopper. \n§7§nItem Life Upgrade \n§0By default the Air Cannon shoots items which have a lifespan of 60 seconds. For each of this upgrades you put in you get an additional 30 seconds. \n§7§nSpeed Upgrade (max = 10) \n§0The cannon will turn faster. \n§7§nRange Upgrade \n§0The shooting range will increase by about 25 blocks per upgrade, up to 250 blocks.
gui.tab.upgrades.tile.air_compressor=§7§nSpeed Upgrade (max = 10) \n§0The Air Compressor will produce more compressed air per tick. However this is at the expense of the efficiency.
gui.tab.upgrades.tile.advanced_air_compressor=§7§nSpeed Upgrade (max = 10) \n§0The Advanced Air Compressor will produce more compressed air per tick. However this is at the expense of the efficiency.
gui.tab.upgrades.tile.assembly_controller=§7§nSpeed Upgrade (max = 10) \n§0All assembly machines that are controlled by this Controller will operate faster.
gui.tab.upgrades.tile.charging_station=§7§nSpeed Upgrade (max = 10) \n§0The Charging Station will be able to (dis)charge items faster. \n§7§nDispenser Upgrade \n§0Adds a charge pad onto the Charging Station, allowing it to (dis)charge any Drones, items, and player inventory items that are on top of the Charging Station.
gui.tab.upgrades.tile.elevator_base=§7§nSpeed Upgrade (max = 10) \n§0The elevator will ascend/descend faster (at a higher pressure cost). \n§7§nCharging Upgrade (max = 4) \n§0Charging Upgrades allow the elevator to reclaim some of the air used to ascend when the elevator descends.
