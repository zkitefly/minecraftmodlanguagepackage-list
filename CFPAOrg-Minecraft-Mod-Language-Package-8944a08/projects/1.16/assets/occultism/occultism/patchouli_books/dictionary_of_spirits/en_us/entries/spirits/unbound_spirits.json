      "text": "Generally spirits are summoned $(thing)bound$(), which refers to any condition that keeps them under control of the summoner. A side effect of binding spells is that part of the spirit remains in $(thing)The Other Place$(), robbing them of large portions of the power, but at the same time also protecting their essence from access in this world."},

      "text": "In order to access a spirit's essence, or unleash it's full destructive power, it needs to be summoned unbound. Unbound summonings use pentacles that are intentionally incomplete or unstable, allowing to call on the spirit, but not putting any constraints on it. As a result these summonings are incredibly dangerous, but often there is no way around them."}
