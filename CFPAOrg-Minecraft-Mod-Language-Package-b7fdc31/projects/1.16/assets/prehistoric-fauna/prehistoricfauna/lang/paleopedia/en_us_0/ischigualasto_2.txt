They appear 
to be a common lunch item for the 
Sillosuchus that live nearby.

Johnstonia
These corystosperm trees also 
dot the landscape with their 
relative Dicroidium. While related,
these are much less common, and 
much shorter. They only grow to 
about 3 meters, compared to 5. 
Despite this, they share the common 
traits seen in seed ferns, with the 
thick leaves. I've noticed that 
Chromogisaurus seem to enjoy the 
Johnstonia that is close enough to 
the ground for them to be able to 
reach.


Cladophlebis
These ferns are by far the most 
common plant here in Ischigualasto. 
If they find the space to grow, 
they occupy it, taking up much of 
the rainforest floor. Because of 
how common they are, I've seen a 
range of creatures feeding on 
them, including the large 
Ischigualastia, to the small 
Exaeretodon. Both have found a 
way to successfully break apart 
the tough leaves.

Scytophyllum
These plants are sparse here in 
Ischigualasto, but I can spot 
them from a distance thanks to 
their large size and bright red 
'flowers'.
