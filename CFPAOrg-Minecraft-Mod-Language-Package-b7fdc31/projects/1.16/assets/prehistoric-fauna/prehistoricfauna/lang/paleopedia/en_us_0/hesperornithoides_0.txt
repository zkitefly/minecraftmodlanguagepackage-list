I've discovered a small 
Troodontid today, which I believe is 
Hesperornithoides. These small 
dinosaurs are covered in blue-ish 
feathers and a large black tuft 
on its head, and are quite a sight 
to behold. The ones that live 
nearby have been quickly darting 
around a Zamites for several 
hours. When I got close though, 
they broke off and ran away 
before stopping and looking 
curiously at me. While scared of my 
size, they are still curious of what 
I may do. I will have to keep my eye 
on them for future research.

While feeding an Eilenodon, a 
Hesperornithoides seized the 
chance and attacked! Quickly 
running in, it snatched the 
Eilenodon, and quickly killed it, 
before dragging it off to eat in 
the scrub. The other Eilenodons 
that were nearby quickly 
scattered. I feel somewhat bad 
for the death of this Eilenodon, 
but seeing the speed of a 
Hesperornithoides on the hunt was 
truly fascinating.
