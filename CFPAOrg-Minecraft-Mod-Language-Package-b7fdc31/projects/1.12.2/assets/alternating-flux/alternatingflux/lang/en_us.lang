ie.manual.entry.alternatingflux0=By carefully modulating Flux, it is possible to transmit it over great distances with minimal power loss. This form of Flux is called §lAlternating Flux§r. However, because all machines operate on normal Flux, Alternating Flux cannot be directly used for powering machines.
ie.manual.entry.alternatingfluxWire=By forming <link;alloys;§o§nConstantan§r> into wire and coating it in <link;graphite;§o§nGraphite§r>, the resistance of the wire is greatly reduced while under the influence of an alternating fluxfield. 
ie.manual.entry.alternatingflux1=AF Wires have much lower power loss than other wires, and due to Constantan's thermo-electric properties, are able to handle great amounts of current without overheating. These properties make AF an excellent choice of wire for long-distance power transfer. Like other wires, the loss is further reduced as the connectors near their maximum capacity.
ie.manual.entry.alternatingfluxRelay=§lAF Relays§r are made in a similar fashion to HV Relays, however, because Alternating Flux cannot power machines, AF Connectors cannot be created.
ie.manual.entry.alternatingfluxTransformer=To modulate Flux into Alternating Flux and back, a special §lAF Transformer§r will be required. AF converts to and from Flux at a 1:1 rate.
ie.manual.entry.alternatingflux2=There are only a few other devices that can handle AF properly.<br>The <link;eMeter;§o§nCurrent Transformer§r> can be used to monitor the power usage over an AF line.<br>A <link;breaker;§o§nRedstone Breaker§r> (unlike a Breaker Switch) is strong enough to handle AF, and can be connected to an AF line to easily disconnect it.
