![Lens Block](block:betterwithmods:lens)

The Lens is a block with two sides, the input and output. When there is a light source of any kind in the block directly next to the input side the output side will create a beam of light up to 256 until interrupt by  
a block or mob. The light source can be detected by a [Block Detector](detector.md).
  
Tip: This allows for long distance Redstone Signals.
