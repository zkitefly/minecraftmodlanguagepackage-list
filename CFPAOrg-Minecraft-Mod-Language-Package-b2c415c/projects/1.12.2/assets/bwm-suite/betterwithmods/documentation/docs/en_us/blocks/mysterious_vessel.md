![Mysterious Vessel](block:betterwithmods:cooking_pot@2)

The Mysterious Vessel can be found in untouched Jungle Temples and has the ability to store up to 30 levels of experience orbs. When given mechanical power from the side, via an [Axle](wooden_axle.md) or a [Hand Crank](hand_crank.md), it will dump the experience that is contains.
