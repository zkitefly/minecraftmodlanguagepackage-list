Pumpjack
Pump, pump it up
<&pumpjack0>
The Pumpjack is a multiblock that pumps Crude Oil from deposits situated underneath bedrock once they have been tapped by the <link;immersivepetroleum:derrick;§o§nDerrick§r>. <np>
The structure is formed by using the Engineering's Hammer on the Heavy Engineering Block on the second layer.

Applying a redstone signal to the control panel will halt the machine's process, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Screwdriver.

The Pumpjack Tower uses <config;i;pumpjack_consumption> Flux/t to pump Crude Oil at a rate of <config;i;pumpjack_speed> mB/t. Fluids are output through the two side ports with orange dots.<np>
Pumpjack head pipes (the well-block at the very tip) must be placed above a pre-drilled well that is exhausted of fluid pressure from the <link;immersivepetroleum:derrick;§o§nDerrick§r>, and cannot pump straight from the ground.

The average Oil deposit will take <config;i;pumpjack_days> days to deplete, though adding more Pumpjacks can speed the process. Within some fluid reservoirs, once the reservoir has been depleted of its fluid, trace fluids can still be extracted by one pumpjack.
