While resting in my camp today, I 
was awoken by a low rumbling 
coming from nearby. Extremely 
cautiously, I investigated, and 
discovered a herd of 
Ischigualastia! These large 
dicynodonts were recognizable 
immediately. These large grazers 
have little to fear, seemingly only 
being preyed upon by 
Saurosuchus. Not only does their 
size protect them, but the fact 
they travel in large herds helps 
discourage carnivores from 
hunting them. As such, they are 
quite docile. I will travel with this 
herd for a while to learn more 
about them.

I discovered today that these 
Ischigualastia love Cladophlebis! 
As a test, I collected some and 
held it out to see if they would 
come. Sure enough, one 
approached and followed me until 	
it was able to eat what I had. Due 
to their docile nature, and their 
hunger for Cladophlebis, it may be 
possible to mount them, and guide 
them somehow.
