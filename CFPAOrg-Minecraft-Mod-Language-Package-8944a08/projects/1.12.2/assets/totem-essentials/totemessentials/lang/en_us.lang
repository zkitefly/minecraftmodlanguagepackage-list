# JEI Integration
jei.totemessentials.item_category.ensouled=The Ensouled version of %s. I wonder what other properties it might have?

jei.tile.totemessentials.reinforced_soul_sand=This decorative block gives you all the lovely Soul Sand-inspired design you want with none of the slowness.

jei.item.totemessentials.exchange_packet=Obtained by using a Totem of Exchange in an anvil with any item. Contains the item's crafting ingredients, which you'll get when you use the packet.

jei.item.totemessentials.totem_shell=The blank slate of totems, a Totem Shell drops from Evokers in Woodland Mansions and can be crafted into many useful types of totems with Essence.
jei.item.totemessentials.phasing_totem=While holding this, you are no longer affected by gravity and you can phase through blocks. The longer you're in a solid block, the more damage this takes; careful you don't lose it while inside a block or you'll suffocate!
jei.item.totemessentials.reaping_totem=If this is in your inventory when you kill certain mobs, they'll drop their Essence and damage this Totem. Different Essences can be crafted into different, useful totems, so reap often!
jei.item.totemessentials.undying_totem=This vanilla Totem will save you from death! Once. If you're holding it when you die. And you don't fall into the void. And lava will still hurt...
jei.item.totemessentials.curing_totem=If you'd be affected by a negative potion effect while a Totem of Curing is in your inventory, it'll be immediately cleared! At the cost of durability. Higher level effects cost more durability to cure.
jei.item.totemessentials.featherfoot_totem=Who needs fall damage? Not you, if you have a Totem of Featherfoot in your inventory! All fall damage will be redirected into the Totem's durability. Until it breaks, and then hopefully your shins won't, too.
jei.item.totemessentials.vampire_totem=No need to suck any blood, as long as you shed it. With a Totem of Vampirism in your inventory, all damage you deal to mobs and players will heal you if needed. Every half-heart healed deals 1 damage to the Totem.
jei.item.totemessentials.traveling_totem=Sneak + Use to set the destination coordinates. Use normally to teleport there. Takes 1 damage for every 10 blocks you travel; if it breaks in the middle of teleporting, you'll get stuck partway through! Hope you don't teleport into lava...
jei.item.totemessentials.replication_totem=Hit a mob with this Totem to bind it to that mob type. Then use the Totem on a block to spawn that mob type. Takes 1 damage per spawn.
jei.item.totemessentials.exchange_totem=Put this in the left slot of an anvil, and it'll decraft whatever's in the right slot into its crafting ingredients. (Right-click an Exchange Packet to get the ingredients back.) DIY made simple.
jei.item.totemessentials.fireglaze_totem=If this drops from your inventory upon your death, it will take 1 damage, and all your dropped items will become fireproof until collected! It only gets two uses, though, and you may have to go hunting for the items with fire resistance potions...
jei.item.totemessentials.storage_totem=When you use this Totem, you'll swap between your bottom-most main inventory row and your hotbar. Except for the slot this Totem is in, of course.
jei.item.totemessentials.aiming_totem=Keep this Totem in your inventory, and all your arrows will fly true! That is, they won't be affected by gravity. Takes 1 damage per arrow enhanced.
jei.item.totemessentials.aggression_totem=If you have this Totem in your inventory and a mob gets angry at you, they'll take out their aggression on another mob around instead. Only works within 20 blocks and when there's another mob for them to target. Takes 1 damage per mob "turned".
jei.item.totemessentials.wisdom_totem=Experience comes with age, and it creates wisdom. It can also come with killing everything in sight. Either way, having a Totem of Wisdom in your inventory will double all XP you earn from orbs, taking 1 damage per extra XP it gives you.
jei.item.totemessentials.gluttony_totem=Keep this in your inventory with some food, and if your hunger drops below 2 haunches, it'll automatically eat the highest-saturation food for you. It takes more damage eating better foods.
jei.item.totemessentials.flamebody_totem=Who needs thorns? Whenever a mob hurts you while you have a Totem of Flamebody in your inventory, they'll be set on fire for 7 seconds. Burn, baby, burn!
jei.item.totemessentials.daunting_totem=When you hear a creeper, doesn't that make you want to run? Just like that, using a Totem of Daunting will push nearby mobs away from you, giving you a clean escape. Especially useful against large mobs of mobs.
jei.item.totemessentials.undying_totem=You know this Totem from the original Minecraft: if you'd die with it in one of your hands, instead it breaks and you get some buffs to keep you alive. Nifty!

jei.item.totemessentials.ensouled_phasing_totem=Just like the normal Totem of Phasing, except twice the durability. Oh, yeah, and it gives you creative-style flight when held, too. Did I forget to mention that?
jei.item.totemessentials.ensouled_traveling_totem=Remember how the normal Totem of Traveling can't teleport you across dimensions? This one can. It takes 10 more damage to transport yourself between different dimensions, but it has twice as much durability anyway. Zoom zoom.
jei.item.totemessentials.ensouled_replication_totem=You can replicate mobs just fine, but they're always a little different... not anymore! The Ensouled Totem of Replication perfectly recreates all the data about the mob you've bound it to. Exact copies every time.
jei.item.totemessentials.ensouled_vampire_totem=Sucking blood is great for a vampire. You know what's not great? The sun. After healing twice as much as a normal Totem of Vampirism, the ensouled version will inflict your victim with the Sunburn effect, causing them to burn up in the sun, like a zombie.
jei.item.totemessentials.ensouled_storage_totem=Instead of just swapping your hotbar with the bottom row of your inventory, the Ensouled Totem of Storage lets you cycle through all your inventory rows. Still can't cycle its own column, though; have you tried using it from your offhand?
jei.item.totemessentials.ensouled_aiming_totem=When you're too far away from your target, even a straight shot can be hard to make. So the Ensouled Totem of Aim also gives the Glowing effect to the mob you're looking at with your bow pulled back! (Within 100 blocks. Depending on render distance. Batteries not included.)
jei.item.totemessentials.ensouled_featherfoot_totem=Not having fall damage? That's good. Floating slowly to the ground like a chicken *and* not having fall damage? Even better!
jei.item.totemessentials.ensouled_fireglaze_totem=Pour some magma (cream) on me! This Totem saves your items from burning when you die, *and* absorbs all fire damage you would take!
jei.item.totemessentials.ensouled_curing_totem=Keep this in your inventory, and it'll cure you of negative potion effects *and* double the duration of your positive potion effects. Plus, it has 30 durability and only takes 1 damage per effect per level. It's like the vitamins to your medicine.
jei.item.totemessentials.ensouled_aggression_totem=If you anger mobs against each other, one will be left standing, and chances are he'll come after you. So get an Ensouled Totem of Aggression to calm down any mobs that would attack you because they have no one else to attack! No losing by default!
jei.item.totemessentials.ensouled_wisdom_totem=Totems of Wisdom are great for gaining more XP, but if you lose it all when you die, what's the point? So don't lose it! Take an Ensouled Totem of Wisdom with you instead, and in addition to doubling your XP, you'll also keep it all when you die! (For a cost of 500 durability...)
jei.item.totemessentials.ensouled_reaping_totem=If you're going to kill someone and steal bits of their soul, you may as well take their heads home as trophies, right?  At least, with this Totem in your inventory, there's a 33% chance of a head dropping from any of the vanilla mobs that have heads. (Wither Skeletons, Creepers, Skeletons, Zombies, and the Ender Dragon.)
jei.item.totemessentials.ensouled_gluttony_totem=A Totem of Gluttony helps with food-based micromanagement, but if you never want to think about food again, try the ensouled verion! No need for food items, it'll top up your hunger when you're low on its own!
jei.item.totemessentials.ensouled_undying_totem=In addition to the normal Totem of Undying saving effects, having the ensouled version anywhere in your inventory also gives you invisibility, gives you fire resistance if fire killed you, and teleports you to your spawn point if you fell into the void.
jei.item.totemessentials.ensouled_flamebody_totem=Is 7 seconds of burning torture not enough revenge on those who've hurt you? Then try an ensouled Totem of Flamebody, which will set mobs on fire for longer the more damage they deal to you! You'll also set burnable mobs on fire for 5 seconds just by bumping into them. Note: other players are very burnable.
jei.item.totemessentials.ensouled_daunting_totem=Creepers aren't just scary. They're also combustible! Use the Ensouled Totem of Daunting while sneaking, and you'll unleash an explosion that doesn't hurt living things, but cleanly cuts out a 5x5x5 cube around you. Cleaner than TNT, safer than creepers!
jei.item.totemessentials.ensouled_exchange_totem=Works the same as the normal Totem of Exchange, except it has more uses and a cheaper XP cost for decrafting exchanges.

jei.item.totemessentials.essence_reaper=Reaper Essence drops from Vindicators, and can be used to create a Totem of Reaping. You'll need that if you want to collect any other type of Essence!
jei.item.totemessentials.essence_vexatious=Vexatious Essence can be reaped from Vexes, funnily enough. Totem magic can harness the Vex's phasing abilities for your own use.
jei.item.totemessentials.essence_undying=Undying Essence, reaped from Zombies, can be crafted into a Totem of Undying. You already know what that does, don't you?
jei.item.totemessentials.essence_lactic=Lactic Essence. Cows give milk, which does a body good! They also can be reaped for Lactic Essence, which can be crafted into a Totem of Curing.
jei.item.totemessentials.essence_featherfoot=Featherfoot Essence, reaped from chickens, can be used to craft a Totem of Featherfoot. Is that better than frying and eating the chickens? That's for you to decide.
jei.item.totemessentials.essence_vampiric=Bats are useless, right? No! They're secretly vampires, so they can be reaped for their Vampiric Essence.
jei.item.totemessentials.essence_traveling=Ender Pearls are so limited. Try some Endermen Essence -- er, Traveling Essence -- to make a Totem of Traveling. This Totem better -- MUCH better!
jei.item.totemessentials.essence_replication=Illusioners like to hide out in Woodland Mansions these days. Maybe a bit of reaping them for their Replication Essence can help you unlock the magicians' secrets?
jei.item.totemessentials.essence_exchange=Villagers sometimes buy materials and give you back crafted items, right? So why not reap their essence to reverse that process? DIY, here you come.
jei.item.totemessentials.essence_fireglaze=If Magma Cubes can drop magma cream, which can make you fireproof, what if you reaped that essence and applied it to a Totem? Maybe it could make your items fireproof, too? Hmm, now there's a thought!
jei.item.totemessentials.essence_storage=Shulker shells can make useful shulker boxes. I wonder what their Storage Essence can make if you reap them?
jei.item.totemessentials.essence_aim=Skeletons carry their bows around so often, you'd think they'd know how to aim! Maybe their essence can help you aim, too?
jei.item.totemessentials.essence_aggro=Zombie Pigmen seem nice, until you annoy them; then they get all hyper-aggressive! That sucks, but imagine if their essence could distract other mobs with that kind of aggro...
jei.item.totemessentials.essence_wisdom=Elder Guardians. They're elders. They've been around long enough that their essence is probably full of experience and wisdom... Maybe you want to reap them?
jei.item.totemessentials.essence_gluttony=Husks are always getting so hungry walking around in the desert. Which means their essence might be delicious! Er, I mean, it might help you manage your hunger... yeah, that...
jei.item.totemessentials.essence_flamebody=Blazes are blazing! As in, they're literally made of fire. Maybe their essence can give you that hot body you've always wanted?
jei.item.totemessentials.essence_daunting=Creepers are quite daunting, aren't they? They creep up on you and scare you... then they explode... could be useful?
