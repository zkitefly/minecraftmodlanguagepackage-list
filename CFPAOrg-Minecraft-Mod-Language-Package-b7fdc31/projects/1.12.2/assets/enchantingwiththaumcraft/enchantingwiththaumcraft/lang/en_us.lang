enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.basic_ench.title=Enchanted Books
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.basic_ench.text.stage.1=While enchanting tables are useful in their own right, the process is seemingly random, and it has become quite the chore to enchant masses of items just to find one particular enchantment. There must be a more efficient way to do this. The types of enchantments normally available tend to change depending on the tool inserted, but the enchanting table lacks any way to incorporate further materials. Perhaps infusion is the key?
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.basic_ench.text.stage.2=My theory turned out to be correct, although it has a few fundamental differences from traditional enchanting. The most obvious is that it incorporates more materials related to the enchantment itself, which thankfully has the side effect of removing the need for experience. This process revolves around two specific items: books and amber. Out of all enchantable materials, books have proven to be the best, able to take on any enchantment desired. Amber is also important, acting as a translator of sorts, allowing even mundane materials to play a role in the choice of enchantment. To this end, I've recreated the most basic enchantments.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.tool_ench.title=Tool Enchantments
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.tool_ench.text.stage.1=The only tool enchantments I've yet to recreate are Silk Touch and Fortune. Fortune is likely related to some sort of gem, but Silk Touch is a bit trickier. Maybe those rare earths I've come across are related somehow?
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.tool_ench.text.stage.2=Success! Fortune and Silk Touch will make for excellent additions to my repertoire. Fortune can be created with Emerald, and Silk Touch requires rare earths, as I suspected, as well as a couple of slime balls, strangely enough.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.weapon_ench.title=Basic Weapon Enchantments
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.weapon_ench.text.stage.1=To begin my research into weapon enchantments, I've decided to look into Sharpness and Knockback. I see only one good candidate for Sharpness: quartz. And for Knockback, as silly as it may seem, pistons could be the answer.
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.weapon_ench.text.stage.2=My hunches were right, though with one caveat. The higher levels of Sharpness also involve diamonds, in addition to quartz. Knockback can be created as expected, with pistons.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.spe_weapon_ench.title=Specialized Weapon Enchantments
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.spe_weapon_ench.text.stage.1=Sharpness works for most purposes, but sometimes I'd prefer a more specialized enchantment, namely Smite or Bane of Arthropods. I wonder if Smite is related to glistering melons, parallel to the potion? Bane of Arthropods is likely unresponsive to normal spider eyes, but fermentation may change the story.
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.spe_weapon_ench.text.stage.2=Looks like I was right, the process of fermentation on spider eyes seems to make them quite potent against their former owners. As for Smite, the lower levels can indeed be created with glistering melons, although the higher levels require an additional ingredient: silverwood saplings. Perhaps there is some truth to the "silver" in silverwood.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.adv_weapon_ench.title=Advanced Weapon Enchantments
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.adv_weapon_ench.text.stage.1=The rare weapon enchantments, Fire Aspect, Looting, and Sweeping Edge, are all fairly simple concepts, but that also means a lot of potential candidates. Thankfully, the nature of alumentum means it should work as a catch-all material for Fire Aspect. As for Looting, gold seems to be the logical starting point. And for Sweeping Edge, I would prefer to use raw lightning but the destructive properties of TNT shall have to suffice.
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.adv_weapon_ench.text.stage.2=It turns out that gold was the key, but a lot more of it is involved in Looting than I expected. The alumentum also worked, although I had to supplement it with blaze rods to finalize the process. As for Sweeping Edge, it seems the TNT was a bit overkill and the lower levels can be created with gunpowder alone.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.bow_ench.title=Basic Bow Enchantments
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.bow_ench.text.stage.1=For bow enchantments, I shall begin with Power and Punch. Ender pearls are likely involved in Punch, as they are easily thrown and do cause movement, albeit strangely. My initial thoughts regarding Power turned towards gems of some sort, but I believe I will need a less rigid substance. I've yet to find many uses for quicksilver, perhaps it has some hidden properties?
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.bow_ench.text.stage.2=Not only were my guesses correct, but these ingredients appear to be the only two items related to the enchantments. Power can be created with increasing amounts of quicksilver; Punch is likewise with ender pearls.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.adv_bow_ench.title=Advanced Bow Enchantments
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.adv_bow_ench.text.stage.1=I believe the Flame enchantment can be easily recreated with the help of alumentum, given its nature as a long-lasting fuel. However, infinity is quite a strange enchantment, seemingly defying the natural laws of the world. Regardless, I believe ender eyes might be connected, seeing as when they are released into the air they are drawn towards some foreign source of energy.
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.adv_bow_ench.text.stage.2=Success! The Flame enchantment was indeed related to alumentum, though the final recipe requires a couple extra clumps of blaze powder. Infinity can also be recreated with ender eyes, though it requires more than I expected.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.armor_ench.title=Basic Armor Enchantments
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.armor_ench.text.stage.1=Now that I've figured out how Protection works, the remaining protection-based enchantments shouldn't be too much of a problem. I believe I have the keys to recreating these enchantments, though the higher levels may require more powerful ingredients.
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.armor_ench.text.stage.2=Blast Protection is created with slime balls, but the higher levels require the most blast-resistant material I could find: obsidian. As for Projectile Protection, it is created with enchanted fabric and supplemented with slime blocks for the more powerful versions. Lastly, Fire Protection requires the use of magma cream, which is strangely cool to the touch, as well as ice for the higher levels, although it may be a problem getting a chunk of ice onto a pedestal.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.adv_armor_ench.title=Advanced Armor Enchantments
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.adv_armor_ench.text.stage.1=To finish up my collection of the standard armor enchantments, all that's needed is Thorns and Feather Falling. Thankfully, both of these enchantments seem to be obviously related to common materials.
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.adv_armor_ench.text.stage.2=As I thought, Thorns can be created with the use of cactus and Feather Falling with, well, feathers. What's more is that no additional ingredients are required.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.aquatic_ench.title=Aquatic Armor Enchantments
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.aquatic_ench.text.stage.1=I've decided to dedicate the water-based enchantments to their own section, as they are all probably related to materials of similar origin. Looks like I'll need to fish up some volunteers for my research.
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.aquatic_ench.text.stage.2=Further examination of these fish have revealed some interesting properties. Clownfish seem to be particularly intelligent, which makes them perfect for Aqua Affinity. Pufferfish are able to hold the largest amount of air, linking them to Respiration. Lastly, Salmon are able to attain the highest speeds, making them the choice for Depth Strider. Unfortunately, cod did not turn out to have any exceptional properties, though I admit they do make for a tasty meal.

enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.rod_ench.title=Fishing Rod Enchantments
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.rod_ench.text.stage.1=Sometimes a thaumaturge just wants to relax, and what better activity than fishing? However, as relaxing as it may be, I can't help but feel I could be relaxing more efficiently. On that thought, I've begun my research into the fishing rod enchantments, namely Lure and Luck of The Sea. Both could be related to a gem of some sort, but that is likely too complicated for a simple fishing enchantment. For Lure, I shall simply look into seeds, and for Luck of The Sea, gold nuggets.
enchantingwiththaumcraft.research.rod_ench.text.stage.2=Lure was indeed related to seeds, though the higher levels will require increasing varieties. Luck of The Sea was also related to gold, but it requires ingots rather than nuggets. The recreation of these enchantments should greatly increase the efficiency of my relaxation.
