While roaming the Morrison, I 
stumbled across a giant foot print. 
As I could easily stand in it, I 
deduced it was some form of 
sauropod. I quickly discovered 
what kind, as I felt a low rumbling 
shake the earth beneath me. I 
turned to find a herd of 
Camarasaurus! These giants 
roamed in a large herd, each 
staying within the same general 
area. Their red noses stood out 
against the rest of it's brown 
body. Everything I saw in the area 
made sure to keep a wide path from 
these Camarasaurus, with their 
sheer size intimidating everything. 
I will have to keep my distance, 
but I must find out more about 
them.

Today, I was lucky enough to spot 
them eating in the distance. They 
large adults were eating from the 
tops of the Ptilophyllum, while the 
young babies were scrounging off 
of the leaves that fell from their 
parents mouths. Truly fascinating 
how these beasts live.
