Despite looking like 
a rose bush of the modern day, 
they are related to the 
corystosperm trees like Dicroidium. 
Their hard seeds are very similar. 
Yesterday, I found a large group 
of Hyperodapedon eagerly eating 
a Scytophyllum which had toppled 
over. I must do more research on 
why these stout little animals love 
a plant normally so high out of 
their reach...

These spiny little plants are an 
uncommon sight, likely because I 
rarely stumble upon them amongst 
the Cladophlebis carpeting the 
ground. They are in fact one of 
the oldest true cycads known! 
Their cones and leaves are quite 
stiff and tough; this may deter 
the animals I've so far seen from 
eating them.
