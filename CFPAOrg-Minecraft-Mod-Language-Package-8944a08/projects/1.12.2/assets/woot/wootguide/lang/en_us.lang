# Foreward Entry Text
guide.woot.entry.foreword.intro.info=Woot is a big, magic multiblock.\n\nYou build the structure, feed it lots of power and it then generates loot.\n\nIf the idea of that horrifies you, then dont use Woot. Build a nice, safe, interesting, creative mob farm instead.
guide.woot.entry.foreword.purpose.info=Woot is one of many solutions to the age old Minecraft problem of wanting lots of mob drops. The traditional way of doing this is to spawn mobs in the world, kill them somehow and then pick up all the drops. If you are not careful, this can cause performance problems.\n\nSo Woot does it in a different way. It learns the loot that mobs drop when they die. Then you create the Woot farm/factory building and program it with the mob that you want to generate the loot for. Provide it enough power and it starts putting the appropriate drops into attached inventories. No entities are generated in the world, so hopefully there is less performace impact. (E&OE)\n\nIt also has a second purpose. I dont like building mob farms, so this is my solution to my problem.
guide.woot.entry.foreword.naming.info=Is it a factory? Is it a farm? I can never decide, so expect both words to be used throughout this guide.
guide.woot.entry.foreword.sponge.info=There are compatibility issues between Woot and SpongeForge. The following issues have been created on the SpongeForge tracker.\n\nCannot capture bosses with the EnderShard - Bug 1912\n\nLooting upgrades produce no output - Bug 1345
guide.woot.entry.foreword.credits.info=This guide is only possible due to Guide-API.\n\nSo thankyou to TeamAmeriFrance and of course the extra work that TehNut did on the BloodMagic guide.

# Factory Entry Text
guide.woot.entry.factory.guide.info=To build the factory you should create a Factory Layout Block. This will allow you to see in the world, where the blocks need to go, as these can be large structures.\n\nPlace the Factory Layout Block on the ground and it will display the factory layout. You can right-click to cycle through different factory tiers.\n\nIn creative mode, clicking with redstone will instantly create the factory.\n\nIf you are upgrading a factory, then you can place the Factory Layout Block one block away underneath the Factory Heart and it will line up correctly with your current structure.\n\nOnce the factory structure is in place, you can validate it by using the Ya Hammer. Sneak right click in the air with the hammer to change modes.\n\nAlternatively you can use The Intern to build the factory for you.
guide.woot.entry.factory.structure.info=The factory structure consists of two structures. The first is the main factory structure where the Heart, Upgrades and Mob Controller live. The second is a remote structure which provides power, import and export of items and fluids. The remote structure must be located at most 10 blocks directly below the Heart. The remote structure consists of a column of three blocks with the Exporter on the bottom, the Importer in the middle and a Power Cell on the top.\n\nThe factory can be turned on and off via a redstone signal to the heart.
guide.woot.entry.factory.importer.info=The Importer is responsible for consuming the ingredients required to spawn certain mobs. It will take items from any inventories adjacent to it and fluids from any tanks adjacent to it.
guide.woot.entry.factory.exporter.info=The Exporter is responsible for generating and items of fluids from the factory. It will place items in any inventories adjacent to it and fluids in any tanks adjacent to it.
guide.woot.entry.factory.power.info=The power cells power the factory and are where you connect any power cables. Any factory tier can use any tier of power cell. Different power cells have different storage capacity and transfer rates. Cells preserve their contents when broken.\n\nPower cables will only connect when the factory is fully formed.
guide.woot.entry.factory.stygianiron.info=Stygian Iron is the basic ore used in this mob. It does not, by default, generate in the world, but can be created using Iron Ore blocks.
guide.woot.entry.factory.capturing.info=Mobs are captured via the Ender Shard and you need a full Ender Shard to generate a Mob Controller for that mob.\n\nTo initialise the Ender Shard with a mob, you need to quietly approach your chosen mob and hit it with the Ender Shard. The tooltip for that shard will then tell you the mob you have captured.\n\nNow you have to fill the shard up, by killing that type of mob while the Ender Shard is in your toolbar. The tooltip will tell you how many you need to kill and the shard will glow when you have enough.
guide.woot.entry.factory.programming.info=To create a Mob Controller to put on the factory, you will need a glowing Ender Shard.\n\nUse this in the Stygian Anvil to produce the programmed controller.\n\nMob Controllers retains their programming when broken, so you can swap between them on the same factory.
guide.woot.entry.factory.stygiananvil.info=The anvil serves two purposes. The first is to create some of the items used for crafting, such as the cores. The second is to reduce the cost of creating some items.\n\nThe anvil must be placed on top of a magma block.\n\nTo create an item using the anvil, right-click with a die which will then be placed on the anvil. Then drop one of each ingredient on top off the anvil and then right-click with the Ya Hammer.\n\nThe dies are created on the anvil in the same way, except that the item to generate the die is placed on the anvil first.
guide.woot.entry.factory.headhunter.info=To build the factory you need mob heads. To assist you in this, there is a Headhunter enchantment. This increases the change of a skull drop when you manually kill a mob.\n\nThis only works on Zombies, Skeletons and Creepers. It has no effect on Wither Skeletons.
guide.woot.entry.factory.intern.info=The Intern is a tool that will place all the factory blocks for you, taking them from your inventory in the process.\n\nPlace the Factory Heart in the world then hold right-click with The Intern tool and the blocks will be placed for that particular tier.\n\nThe tier that The Intern will build can be changed by shift-clicking in the air with the tool.\n\nThis can also be used to upgrade existing factories.\n\nNote that the remote I/O structure will not be placed by The Intern.

guide.woot.entry.factory.tiers.info=There are four tiers of factory available. Depending on the mob you want to spawn, each has a minimum factory tier that is needed. Higher tiers can also support a larger number of upgrades and higher tiers of upgrades.\n\nAll tiers of factory support all the power cells.
guide.woot.entry.factory.tiers.tieri=Tier I factory supports\n\tUp to 2 Tier I upgrades\n\nTier I factory needs\n\t2 Tier I Capstones\n\t14 Factory Bone Casing\n\t10 Factory Flesh Casing

# Upgrades Entry Text
guide.woot.entry.upgrades.intro.info=The upgrades allow you to change the way that the factory works, maybe spawning more mobs or generating XP on each mob death etc. Each upgrade has three different tiers. The higher the upgrade tier the more powerful it is. Of course they also cost more to craft and run.
guide.woot.entry.upgrades.totems.info=Each upgrade tier needs the previous tier to be present to work. eg. to use a Tier III upgrade, you need both the Tier I and Tier II of that particular upgrade.\n\nThe upgrades are placed onto the factory upgrade bases. The Tier I goes on first, then the Tier II and the Tier III on top. This creates an upgrade totem for that particular upgrade.\n\nRemember that each factory tier only supports a certain number of upgrades and tier of upgrade.
guide.woot.entry.upgrades.mobs.info=The impact of an upgrade will depends on the mob that the factor is spawning. For example the Tier II Mass upgrade may spawn four extra zombies, but only one extra Wither Boss.
guide.woot.entry.upgrades.decapitation.info=This upgrade increases the chances of a mob head dropping. Higher tiers of this upgrade increase that drop chance.
guide.woot.entry.upgrades.efficiency.info=This upgrade decreases the power cost to run the factory. Higher tiers of this upgrade increase that power saving.
guide.woot.entry.upgrades.looting.info=This upgrade applies different levels of looting to the mob kills. This can cause mobs to drop more loot when killed.
guide.woot.entry.upgrades.mass.info=This upgrade spawns more mobs at a time. Higher tiers of this upgrade increases the number of mobs.
guide.woot.entry.upgrades.rate.info=This upgrade decreases the time between mob spawns. Higher tiers of this upgrade decrease the time further.
guide.woot.entry.upgrades.xp.info=By default the factory does not generate XP when a mob is killed. This upgrade causes XP shards to be generated with higher tiers generating extra XP.

# BloodMagic Entry Text
guide.woot.entry.bloodmagic.intro.info=The factory can support upgrades to assist with Blood Magic. Primarily these are for generating Life Essence. They are available at the same time as the traditional Well Of Suffering ritual.
guide.woot.entry.bloodmagic.tank.info=Using the Tank Upgrades and this ritual will generate Life Essence into export tanks. The different tiers change the number of sacrifice runes used when killing the mobs.\n\nThe ritual will look for the Factory Heart in a 10 block radius, both horizontally and vertically.
guide.woot.entry.bloodmagic.altar.info=Using the Altar Upgrades and this ritual will generate Life Essence directly into an altar. The different tiers change the sacrifice amount per mob. This ritual uses the standard altar mechanics for determining the amount of Life Essence (eg. altar rune setup)\n\nThe ritual will look for the Factory Heart in a 10 block radius, both horizontally and vertically.\n\nThe ritual will look for an altar in a 5 block radius and 10 blocks vertically.
guide.woot.entry.bloodmagic.crystal.info=Using the Crystal Upgrades and this ritual will accelerate the growth of crystal in a 7x7 area and 5 high.\n\nThe ritual will search for the Factory Heart in a 21x21x21 area. As theses are cloned mobs, there is no uniqueness boost unlike the Blood Magic crystal growth ritual.

# Anvil Text
guide.woot.entry.anvil.intro.info=The anvil serves two purposes. The first is to create some of the items used for crafting, such as the cores. The second is to reduce the cost of creating some items.\n\nThe anvil must be placed on top of a magma block.
guide.woot.entry.anvil.dies.info=Most items created from the anvil require a die to be placed on the anvil. These dies are reusable and are created in the anvil.\n\nTo create the dies, right-click the required ingredient on the anvil, then drop a Stygian Iron Plate on the anvil. Right-click with the Ya Hammer and a corresponding die will be generated.
guide.woot.entry.anvil.usage.info=To create an item using the anvil, right-click with a die which will then be placed on the anvil.\n\nThen drop one of each ingredient on top of the anvil and then right-click with the Ya Hammer.\n\nThe anvil is the only place where the Mob Controller can be created.
