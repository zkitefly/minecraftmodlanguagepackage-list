![Block Detector](block:betterwithmods:detector)

The Block Detector creates a continuous Redstone Signal while there is something directly in its face. 
This includes:
* Rain (when facing directly up)
* Solid Block 
* Mobs  
* [Lens](lens.md) light sources.  
* Vines 
* Sugarcane 
* It will also detect fully grown crops from 1 block above them.
