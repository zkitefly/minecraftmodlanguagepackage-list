It emits a $(#f00)redstone signal/$ as result of this, which follows the following formula:$(p)  $(formula)0.2 * flow (mL/tick)/$$(p)E.g. with 20mL/tick of air flowing, the signal level will be 20*0.2=4."

So if you have (say) an $(l:machines/elevator)Elevator/$ which isn't running, the flow will be 0, but when it runs it will be consuming air, so the flow will be non-zero. So this module can be used to detect if a machine is using air.$(p)The Flow Detector Module does not accept an $(l:tubes/advanced_pcb)Advanced PCB/$."
